            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT St. <hi>Paul</hi> told his Converts in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> might,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note> with equal certainty, be said to all Churches whatsoever, There must be Heresies among you:<note place="margin">Matth. 24.11.</note> Our Lord's Prophecy must be fulfilled, Many false Prophets shall rise, and deceive many.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> also tells us, There shall be false Teachers among you. So long as there shall be a malicious Devil in Hell, and Men of corrupt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Earth, the Providence of God for wise Ends so permitting, there will never be a want of fit Instruments to raise Heresies, Sects, and Factions, and to defend and spread them too.</p>
            <p>The Words, <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Sect,</hi> were at first of a middle and indifferent use, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying any Profession or Opinion, whether good or bad. By these names the whole Christian Religion hath been stiled, and

            </p>
            <p>But in process of time both these words came to be used in an ill Sense only; and so by the word, <hi>Heresie,</hi> is meant, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> tell us, <hi>Non omnis error,</hi> not every mistake in matters of Religion; but as <hi>Ravanellus</hi> well defines it, <hi>Pertinax error labefactans aut evertens fundamentum fidei,</hi> such an errour, as, being obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended, tends to shake or overturn some Fundamental Article of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:65890:3"/>
            <p>And what is the danger of Heresie, we learn both from God and Man; I will not say, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> doth, who,<note place="margin">Maldonat. in Mat. 13.26.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Hereticks to the <hi>Tares</hi> in the Parable, determines positively thus, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turè sunt evellenda, maturè combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renda,</hi> They are very speedily to be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and burnt.

            <p>And as the Laws of <hi>Men</hi> both Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical and Civil did treat all obstinate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks with great severity, so doth the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Law threaten them with greater.

But as the Canker, if not timely prevented, spreads farther in the Flesh, so Heresy, if not restrained by Authority, and confuted by solid Arguments, is apt to grow till it become Epidemical.</p>
            <p>We may say of plausible Heresies, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of pleasant Vices,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.6.</note>

For there is no sort of Men more affable, more condescending, and more colloguing than they; and they have great reason so to be, for if once by <hi>fawning</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65890:6"/> and flattering they can insinuate <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> into the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men, they find it the easier Task by <hi>subtle Pretences,</hi> by gentle Steps and Degrees, to instil their cursed <hi>Opinions</hi> into their <hi>Heads</hi> too. But</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The second Course which Hereticks take to divulge and spread their erroneous Doctrines, is by <hi>Writing</hi> and publishing Books, wherein they offer such seeming Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in defence of their ill Opinions, as the generality of Men know not how to answer.</p>
            <p>This is the more speedy way which our modern <hi>Socinians</hi> take to gain greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Proselytes than can be got by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conference; their printed Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warily and closely written, and spread throughout the Nation, may, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, pervert multitudes of easy, flexible and unstabled Men, who are too apt to be <hi>Convinced</hi> by every Argument, which they themselves are not able to <hi>Confute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To shake the Faith, and stagger the Minds of Orthodox Christians touching the Dictrine of the <hi>Glorious Trinity,</hi> there came out a little Book, which by mere Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident I met with. A Book stuffed with Blasphemous Falshoods, too much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Humane Reason, abusing the Sacred Word of God, denying the Divinity of
<pb facs="tcp:65890:6"/> Christ, and the Personality of the Holy Ghost. What Censure its <hi>Author</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, let Authority judge; but I will venture to say that the <hi>Book</hi> itself doth both <hi>deserve</hi> and <hi>need</hi> the Flames; for 'tis so abominably <hi>foul,</hi> that nothing can <hi>purge</hi> it, save only that which <hi>consumes</hi> it too.</p>
            <p>To this Book I expected a reply from some other hand; but in four or five Months none appearing, I thought that Time and Pains would not be lost, which should be spent in writing, and in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing an Answer to it, as my health and leisure would permit.</p>
            <p>This Book was first put into my hand by a very Eminent Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who informed me that its Author is by Trade a <hi>Clock-maker.</hi> This being so, it may be thought a matter of no great Credit for a <hi>Divine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to dispute a point of Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an illiterate <hi>Mechanick.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, laying aside both <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> of <hi>gaining</hi> or <hi>losing</hi> any Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereby, I resolved to undertake it, that I might prevent that Mischief which this pestilent Book, by its false Pretences and Abuses of Scripture, might otherwise do among ignorant, easy, and perhaps well-meaning Christians. Nor indeed can I
<pb facs="tcp:65890:7"/> think it to be a thing of <hi>Dishonour,</hi> but rather an incumbent <hi>Duty</hi> to defend Truths, especially those of the highest Magnitude, by whomsoever they chance to be opposed.</p>
            <p>But if I have not effectually done what I really designed to do, if my Arguments for Truth be not what I think they are, sufficient to confute this Man's Pretences for Error; the Doctrines which I have here asserted, being very deserving and capable of a just Defence; I hope that by this well intended, though weak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of mine,<note place="margin">Horatius de Arte Poetica.</note>
               <hi>fungar vice cotis,</hi> &amp;c.

            <head>THE FIRST SECTION Containing the INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE Author of this little Tract designed thereby, as its Title imports, to put a full end to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy; an excellent Design, were it rightly intended, fairly managed, and well accomplished. The main thing concerned in this Controversy is the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> both which our <hi>Socinians</hi> deny, and we assert.</p>
            <p>This Dispute began betimes, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our <hi>Lord</hi> himself and the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, being blind and prepossess'd with prejudice against his <hi>Person,</hi> his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> his <hi>Miracles,</hi> and his <hi>Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> too, denied him to be the promised <hi>Messias,</hi> and the Son of God. And when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65890:11"/> our Lord had affirm'd himself to be both, they attempted to stone him, and gave him this Reason for it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.33.</note>
               <hi>Because thou being a man,</hi> a mere man, as they thought, <hi>makest thy self God,</hi> here was, though not a <hi>Verbal,</hi> yet an <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> and practical denial of our Lord's Divinity.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Jews was <hi>Ebion,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him that Villain <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who held and endeavoured to propagate the same Cursed Opinion, which gave St. <hi>John</hi> a just occasion to write that Holy <hi>Gospel</hi> of his, wherein by such plain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as can never be fairly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he hath infallibly proved that our blessed Saviour is truly <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Lord's Divinity, which had been given by Prophets, Evangelists or Apostles, there was still a sort of men, who, because they could not reconcile this mysterious Doctrine to their own corrupted and shallow Reason, resolved to oppose and dispute against it. And by this means the Peace of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church was so much disturb'd, that the good Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great thought it necessary to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> to determine this so grand a Controversy.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65890:11"/>
            <p>In this first General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which consisted of 318 Bishops, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Lord's <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiality</hi> with his Father was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, and after mature deliberation, and the strictest enquiries into the Word of God, which those Bishops were as likely to understand as any men of that or after Ages, was <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi> as sound and Orthodox; very few of that great number dissenting, and most of those few, upon second thoughts, subscribing to it.</p>
            <p>But this almost unanimous Consent of this famous Council did not end this Controversy; for, in a short time it was revived, and hath been ever since more or less carried on, in several Ages, by men of several denominations; they, who were once called <hi>Ebionites, Arians, Phocinians, Sabellians, Macedonians,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Socinians,</hi> do now distinguish themselves by a new Character, and without all reason, usurp and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to the men of their own Opinion the Name of <hi>Unitarians,</hi> as if we, who believe a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> did also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we do willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that some of those Persons, who formerly did, and yet do, oppose the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65890:12"/> Doctrine of the Trinity, were and still are Men of Parts and Learning; but it is too-hard a task for the ablest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to <hi>defend</hi> a <hi>falshood,</hi> and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a foul matter by fair pretences; and such a matter is that Opinion, for which these Men contend; so gross an Error, so contrary to Divine Revelation, that it is somewhat of wonder, that any Man of Parts and Piety should ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouse, countenance and own it</p>
            <p>But altho' it hath been so, though some Learned Men have put their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to the very utmost stretch to invent Pretences against our Lord's Divinity; yet the strongest Arguments which their most subtle Disputants have ever raised either from Scripture or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, have been fairly answer'd and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baffled by the judicious Writers of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>And yet the Enemies of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truth being Men of presuming and restless Spirits, the Controversy hath been continued and prosecuted; tho' not with equal Vigour, from one Generation to another: But now, in this Age of ours, there hath unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly started up, tho' not dropt down from the Clouds, a Man who intends to do great Wonders; I mean to put an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65890:12"/> end to that Controversy, which hath lasted and perplexed the Christian Church so many hundred Years.</p>
            <p>Now, one would think, that he, who undertakes this Noble, but Difficult Work, should be a Person of rare En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, an incomparable Scholar, an excellent Textuary, a very choice Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in the Original Languages of his Bible, well versed in School-Divinity, and such an acute Disputant, that the poor baffled <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> being clearly convinced by the irresistible Strength of his Arguments, submitting to his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgment, may all at once come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as <hi>Proselytes</hi> to his Opinion, and for ever acquiesce in his uncontroulable Determinations,</p>
            <p>Such a Man, and so qualified, this very assuming <hi>Socinian</hi> Champion should be; but pray, who is it? he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if his Printer do not Nick-name him, <hi>John Smith,</hi> and truly, as the Poet observes, <hi>Conveniunt rebus nomina saepe suis,</hi> this Person's <hi>Name</hi> is appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site enough, and somewhat of kin to his <hi>Occupation;</hi> for, I am inform'd by an Eminent Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> whom I have great Reason to believe, that this great Undertaker and Reconciler, is by Trade a <hi>Clock-maker,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65890:13"/> a Man in all probability, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any thing of a liberal and learned Education; perhaps indeed some little Skill in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> may be useful to him, in framing a Clock; but in his managing this great controverted Point of Divinity, as we do not expect any <hi>Mathematical;</hi> so neither can we find any <hi>Logical</hi> Demonstrations. And is it not an Instance of unparallell'd <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi> that an <hi>illiterate Mechanick,</hi> who should rather handle the <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Hammer,</hi> than the <hi>Scholar</hi>'s <hi>Pen,</hi> should ever hope to produce stronger Reasons and clearer Texts to end this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy by disproving our Lord's Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than any learned Men of his own Perswasion were ever yet able to do? Is it not a sign of intolerable <hi>Arrogance,</hi> that an unlearned <hi>Tradesman</hi> should be so highly conceited of his own Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to think himself sufficient to confute all the Arguments, which have been urged by General <hi>Councils,</hi> Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Fathers,</hi> and later <hi>Divines,</hi> even Men of incomparable Parts, to prove that our blessed Saviour is really and truly God? Certainly, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus est,</hi> it is a difficult Task indeed, but yet it must be done by him, who would end this Controversy; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65890:13"/> a <hi>Clock-maker</hi> be a likely Man to do so great a Work, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>But, by the way, since in this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Age of ours, we have good store of <hi>Lay-Preachers,</hi> it is the less wonder, that we now find some <hi>Lay-Disputers</hi> too; they, who had the face without any Steps and University Degrees <hi>per Saltum,</hi> to leap from the <hi>Shop-board</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Minister</hi>'s <hi>Pulpit,</hi> may with equal right, invade the King's Divinity <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi>'s <hi>Chair;</hi> but of the two, it is an easier Adventure for a bold <hi>Ignoramus</hi> to <hi>prate</hi> in a Pulpit, as our <hi>Apron Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> did, where none opposed them, than to <hi>Dispute</hi> against any one learned Antagonist; 'tis but an easy thing for a Man of much assurance to <hi>repeat</hi> a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and probably some <hi>other</hi> Man's; but 'tis a much harder Task to <hi>solve</hi> and untie a knotty <hi>Argument:</hi> whether our <hi>Clock-maker</hi> be a <hi>Preacher</hi> or not, I cannot tell; but he hath undertook a more difficult Work, and ventured to <hi>Dispute,</hi> tho' not in <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> yet in <hi>Print.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let us try his Strength, and consider whether he hath obtain'd his End, and according to his Design, brought the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controversy to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65890:14"/> such a Conclusion, that there may be no room left for any more Disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Matter.</p>

         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>SECT. II.</head>
            <p>THis Author, in the very entrance of his Work and his first two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, makes it his only business to prove these two Propositions. 1. That there is a God. 2. That this True God is but one in Nature and Essence. Were this Man disputing against an <hi>Atheist,</hi> who thinks that there is <hi>no God;</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a <hi>Pagan,</hi> who thinks that there are <hi>many,</hi> the proof of these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been necessary; but in a Book levelled against us <hi>Trinitarians</hi> only, who own a God, and but one, it might have been spared. For, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose should a Man take Pains, muster up Arguments, and cite several Texts, to confirm those Truths to us, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already convinced and satisfied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; do acknowledge them as readily as he? That God is, and is but one, is a Truth so evident from the Light of Scripture, and right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too; that, as no <hi>Christian</hi> doth, so no intelligent <hi>Heathen,</hi> who improves
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65890:14"/> and exerciseth his natural Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can deny or doubt it, if this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thinks us guilty of <hi>Polytheism,</hi> let him prove that Charge against us, if he can; but if he hath no such Thoughts concerning us, what need he have spent his two first Pages in confirming a Truth, which none of us, against whom he writes, ever did, nor can deny.</p>
            <p>There must indeed be something of <hi>Prudence</hi> and Policy in beginning with these two granted Truths; that his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's mind, being prepossess'd and well seasoned with both these Preliminaries and well known <hi>Verities</hi> might be the less inclinable to suspect any <hi>Falshood</hi> in any of those Assertions, which are to follow; for a <hi>few Truths,</hi> intermingled amongst <hi>many Errors,</hi> seem like a <hi>little Sugar</hi> sprinkled amonst a greater <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of <hi>Ratsbane,</hi> which renders the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the more palatable, and tempts the silly and cheated Vermin to swallow it down so much the sooner.</p>
            <p>But if this Author laid down these Truths, as the necessary Foundations of his future Buildings; sure I am, those <hi>Superstructures,</hi> which he hath thought fit to add, can never be <hi>cemented</hi> to them, nor <hi>stand</hi> firm upon them; for, the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead</hi> is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65890:15"/> with the <hi>Trinity</hi> of those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Persons,</hi> whom we believe and worship.</p>
            <p>But, in Opposition to this, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth in express Terms lay down a third Proposition, namely this, <hi>That this one true God is but one in Person;</hi> and this, saith he, is evident; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it be so indeed, it will do this Man's work: and according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, it will bring the <hi>Socinian</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy to an end; but if the Truth of this Proposition be indeed so <hi>Evident,</hi> as this Man makes it; How come so many thousand Persons, who had very good <hi>Eyes</hi> in their Heads, not to <hi>see</hi> it? How come we poor Men, to be so far mistaken, as to think this third Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to be as <hi>False,</hi> as the other two are <hi>true?</hi> The Scripture tells us that there is but <hi>One</hi> true God, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; the Scripture also tells us, <hi>There are Three Persons that bear record in Heaven;</hi> and why should we not believe that too?</p>
            <p>And yet notwithstanding this and many other Texts, which clearly prove the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and notwithstanding the General Belief of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> concerning it, this <hi>Heretical Clock-maker,</hi> in despight of God and Man, makes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65890:15"/> bold to say, <hi>'Tis Evident that God can in no sense be any more than one in Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bold Assertion is not absolute and perfect <hi>Atheism,</hi> but 'tis somewhat like it, and a fair step towards it; it is a <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Atheism</hi> to <hi>limit</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of God, and confine it, as some have done, to <hi>Heaven;</hi> and what is it less to limit the <hi>Personality</hi> of God, and to contract <hi>Three</hi> Persons into <hi>One?</hi> Verily, this Man, who doth so, had need secure himself upon the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Grounds, that those two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whom he thus excludes from the <hi>God-head,</hi> are but <hi>imaginary,</hi> such as have no <hi>Entity,</hi> save only in the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of deceived Men; for, if these Persons should at length prove <hi>real Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as millions of very understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons formerly did, and still do believe; he, who <hi>denieth,</hi> and as far as he can, <hi>dethrones</hi> these Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, may justly expect to feel the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most severity of that Divine Vengeance, which is due to such horrid <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and Impiety.</p>
            <p>And if this <hi>Socinian Hypothesis,</hi> if false, be certainly attended with the greatest Danger; then every Man who owns it, and valueth his own Soul, is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65890:16"/> highly concerned by the most undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arguments to make it good. The question then is, How comes this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to be so fully satisfied about the Truth of this Assertion, as to publish his own Perswasion of it to the World, and as a publick Act of Charity to his Neighbours Souls, to recommend it to other Men? How doth he prove it? I answer two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To prove this bold Assertion, <hi>That there is but one Person in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> this great Pretender doth make no use of Scripture.</p>
            <p>To prove some other of his Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he doth sometimes quote great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of places out of the Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists and Apostles; but in this case, where he had most need to prove this, he doth not, because indeed he could not cite so much as one single Text. The Scriptures indeed do often tell us, that there is but <hi>one God;</hi> but they do no where tell us, that there is but <hi>one Person</hi> in the <hi>Godhead;</hi> nor can this be ever proved by any Consequences fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn from Sacred Writ; for no Consequence can be Genuine, which contradicts the express Letter of those Texts, which are not <hi>figurative,</hi> and wherein the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avouched.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65890:16"/>2. To prove this bold Assertion, <hi>That there is but one Person in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> this great <hi>Schoolman,</hi> or some body for him, makes use of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from some of God's <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> and naming three, he argues thus, <hi>If the Divine Nature did contain in it several Persons, then each of those must he truly Immense, truly Almighty, and truly most Wise:</hi> We grant it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> is so; but this Author thinks this impossible, and that impossibility he endeavours to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate by two Instances, relating to the <hi>Omnipotence</hi> and infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God; and thus he Reasons;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suppose,</hi> saith he, <hi>two such beings as A and B; now if the Person of A can do more than the Person of B, then the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of B cannot do more than the Person of A;</hi> but hold a little, this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is often false; for suppose by the Letter <hi>A,</hi> we should mean our <hi>Author,</hi> and by the Letter <hi>B,</hi> we should mean his <hi>Answerer,</hi> then the Argument must run thus, If this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can do more than his Answerer, then his Answerer cannot do more than this Author. This Inference is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly untrue, for this Author can make a <hi>Clock,</hi> which is more than his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65890:17"/> can do; and yet his Answerer can make some shift to understand <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; which, I presume, is somewhat more than our <hi>Clockmaker</hi> can do.</p>
            <p>But I am of Opinion that by <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> our Author intends two Persons by him only <hi>supposed,</hi> but by us firmly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> to subsist in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> I mean the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> now if this be his meaning, his Argument must run thus. If the Person of the Father can do more than the Person of the Son, then the Person of the Son cannot do more than the Person of the Father; for if he could, then would not the Father be able to do more than the Son, and by consequence he could not be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; so reasons this <hi>subtle Sophister;</hi> but verily this way of argumentation is much to blame; upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is a plane; <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> the begging of a question. He takes that for a granted <hi>Truth,</hi> and grounds his Argument upon it, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and can prove to be a <hi>Falsehood;</hi> he presumes and takes it, <hi>pro concesso,</hi> that the <hi>Father</hi> can do more than the <hi>Son;</hi> which we deny.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:65890:17"/>2. Whereas we affirm that the <hi>Father</hi> cannot do more than the <hi>Son,</hi> he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes, and saith, that then by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the <hi>Father</hi> cannot be <hi>Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But truly this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> if he seeth the necessity of this Consequence must have more and better Eyes, than ever <hi>Argus</hi> had; for cannot the Father be Almighty unless he can do more than the Son, who is Almighty too? It is the Belief of the Catholick Church, warranted either by express Texts, or evident Deductions from them, that the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> is one and the same <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God;</hi> Co-essential, and Co-equal, in Power, Wisdom, and all other Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Perfections, which are natural to, and inherent in the Deity; whatever any <hi>one</hi> of them can <hi>do</hi> or <hi>know, every one</hi> of them can <hi>do</hi> and <hi>know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here perhaps this Author may thus reply, that by our equally ascribing the whole Divine Nature to the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> we make <hi>three Gods</hi> as well as <hi>three Persons;</hi> perhaps he may say, as some have done before him, that as the <hi>humane Nature,</hi> being communicated to <hi>three distinct Persons,</hi> doth constitute <hi>three</hi> several <hi>Men;</hi> so the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>three</hi> distinct <hi>Subsistences,</hi> must
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65890:18"/> needs constitute <hi>three</hi> several <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this supposed Objection we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thus; The forenamed Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the inference from it, are both naught, and so cannot hold; for, there is a vast difference in the Case, the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi> being <hi>finite</hi> and limited, cannot be communicated to <hi>three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> without <hi>separation;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where it is so communicated, it must of necessity constitute <hi>three</hi> several <hi>Men,</hi> whose Nature is, not <hi>numerically,</hi> but <hi>specifically</hi> the same. But with the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature</hi> it is not so; for, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>infinite,</hi> and <hi>indivisible,</hi> and entirely communicated to <hi>three Persons, distinct</hi> indeed, but not <hi>divided,</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute <hi>three</hi> several <hi>Gods,</hi> for, the Divine Essence of each Person is not <hi>specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> but <hi>numerically</hi> the same.</p>
            <p>And from this <hi>Unity</hi> of their <hi>Essence</hi> ariseth the <hi>Identity</hi> of their Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; they are alike in Power, alike in Wisdom, and so in all other essential Excellencies; so that notwithstanding this Author's absurd <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> may be, and certainly is, both <hi>Almighty</hi> and <hi>All-Wise,</hi> tho' he cannot do nor know <hi>more</hi> than the Son; and the <hi>Son</hi> also may be, and certainly is both <hi>Almighty</hi> and <hi>All-Wise,</hi> though he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65890:18"/> cannot do nor know <hi>more</hi> than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so that this Man's Argument drawn from the Divine Attributes, doth no way prove that, for which he brings it, namely— That the True God is but <hi>One</hi> in Person.</p>

         <div n="3" type="section">

            <p>THE next thing, which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor attempts, is the proof of this Proposition, <hi>That this One Person, who is truly God, is he only, who was the God of Israel, and is now called the Father of Jesus Christ.</hi>— To which we answer thus,</p>
            <p>That the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was and is the only True God, we easily grant; but that this God of <hi>Israel</hi> was and is but <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Person,</hi> we must not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient Proof, take this or any other Man's bare Word.

            <p>But this Author goeth on to prove, as well as he can, that the true God of <hi>Israel</hi> was only he, who is the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of Jesus Christ; by whom he means, and so do we, the <hi>first</hi> Person in the Deity; but, by his favour, we do not believe that the <hi>first</hi> Person <hi>only</hi> is the true God, nor can he ever prove him so.</p>
            <p>For, of those many Texts, which he cites out of the <hi>New Testament</hi> to prove that the <hi>Father</hi> of Christ <hi>alone,</hi> is truly God, there is but <hi>one,</hi> which doth so much as <hi>seem</hi> to give any Countenance, though indeed it gives none at all, to his Opinion.

               </gap> suppose that this is the Text, upon which this Man doth principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, because he mentions it in his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Page, and here cites it first; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65890:20"/> had he cited no more, he had shewed himself so much the wiser; for, all the other Scripture, to which he appeals, do, as to his present purpose, signify nothing.</p>
            <p>And indeed, even this Text, rightly understood, as to his Design, signifieth as little; for our Lord doth not here say, as this man thinks, that his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only</hi> is the true God; but that he is, which we readily grant, the <hi>only true God.</hi> Now, there is a very wide difference betwixt this Proposition, which the Text contains, <hi>the Father is the only true God;</hi> and this, which the Text contains not, <hi>the Father only is the true God;</hi> the former Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition excludes from the Godhead only the <hi>false</hi> Gods of the Heathen World, but the latter, were it contained in the Text, would exclude the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> whose Deity we do justly own, and religiously adore.</p>
            <p>This heretical Inference, which this man would force from this Text, is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposite to the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of such learned Men, whose Judgments are far to be preferred before that of an <hi>illiterate Mechanick.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> expounding these Words of Christ, infers his <hi>Divinity</hi> from them; for,

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; the addition of these Words, <hi>And Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,</hi> doth evidently declare, that by <hi>the only true God,</hi> our Lord meant not his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only,</hi> but <hi>himself</hi> too.</p>
            <p>For, as the same Father in the same Discourse doth argue well; if this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>the only true God,</hi> must be so <hi>restrained</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> as to <hi>exclude</hi> the <hi>Son;</hi> Why might not some other like Expressions, by a parity of Reason,

            <p>And yet such was the Opinion of <hi>Arius,</hi> who, in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected this Text against the Divinity of Christ, saying thus; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And indeed, that these fore-named Authors were not at all mistaken in their Interpretation of this Text, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from that assertion of St. <hi>John,</hi> who positively saith of Christ,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20.</note>
               <hi>This is the True God, and Life Eternal.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, St. <hi>John,</hi> being an inspired A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle did not, could not leave the World a <hi>false Character</hi> of his Master,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65890:23"/> and by representing him as the true God, if he were not so, seduce the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> throughout all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages into an Idolatrous Worship, against which he himself hath left us this friendly Caution, and that in the very next words, <hi>Little Children keep your selves from Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, if we dare rely upon the Judgment of these and many more learned Interpreters, Men famous in their Generations; nay, if we dare trust the Authority of St. <hi>John</hi> himself, who was our Lord's most beloved Disciple; we must acknowledge, that when our Saviour called his Father, the <hi>only true God,</hi> he meant it only in opposition to the many <hi>false</hi> Gods of the Pagan World, but as for <hi>his own</hi> Divinity, his whole Expression took together doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>confirm</hi> than <hi>disprove</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And if from this Text our Author can find no Countenance for that ill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his, with which he seems to be enamoured, if he shall turn his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over and over, I am confident, that if he will not <hi>strain</hi> and force the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but permit every Text plainly to speak its own Sense, and according to the Analogy of our Christian Faith, he will not find, after all his Scrutiny,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65890:24"/> so much as any one Text, from which he can fairly infer this Conclusion, which he owns as a Truth, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove it such; namely, that the True God, who was the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and is the Father of Christ, is but <hi>one</hi> in Person.</p>

            <p>AND now it may be an Act of Charity to convince this Author of his Error, and to shew him, that the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> who is now called, the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> was not, is not, as this Man asserts, only <hi>one</hi> in Person. For although the <hi>Father</hi> of our Lord, in respect of his <hi>eternal</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which this Man denieth, were <hi>one</hi> Person only; yet besides this one Person, there are <hi>two</hi> more, who were the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> and one of these two may be called in an especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and a very good Sense the <hi>Father</hi> of Christ in regard of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of which more hereafter in a more proper place.</p>
            <p>That the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person, hath been the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65890:24"/> Belief of the Catholick Church, and still is the common Faith of our best Divines; nor is this rashly believed, nor took up only as a <hi>Tradition</hi> derived from our Progenitours; but they, who were and are of this Opinion, had and have such strong Reasons for it, as all the Enemies of this Truth can never overthrow.</p>
            <p>Now, to prove that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was indeed <hi>more</hi> than <hi>one</hi> in Person, I shall use two sorts of Argumemts; 1. Such Arguments as seem to be very <hi>fair,</hi> plausible, and to carry great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in them; as being grounded upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of judicious Men, and their common Interpretations of such and such Texts. 2. Such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are <hi>Apodeictical,</hi> Demonstrative, and undeniable; as being grounded upon the express, plain, and infallible <hi>Word</hi> of God; such Texts, as can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit but of one Sense only.</p>
            <p>The probable Arguments which I shall use to prove that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was <hi>more</hi> than one in Person, shall be these Two;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God, who often appeared to <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Moses,</hi> and other good Men of the Jewish Nation, was the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But that God, who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65890:25"/> thus appeared, was more than One in Person.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God, who appeared in the Flaming Bush, and <hi>delivered</hi> the Law to <hi>Moses,</hi> was the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But that God, who thus appeared, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law, was <hi>more</hi> than <hi>one</hi> in Person.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="section">
            <head>SECT. V.</head>
            <p>MY first Argument, which doth probably prove that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person, is this; That God who often appeared to <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Moses,</hi> and other Men of the Jewish Nation, was the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But that God, who thus appeared, was more than <hi>one</hi> in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65890:25"/> him; so the <hi>Arabick,</hi> super, <hi>over</hi> or <hi>above</hi> him; so the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>But though at first sight <hi>Abraham</hi> might think these three Persons to be no more than Men, yet he quickly seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of another mind; for, the Text saith, <hi>He bowed himself down to the ground,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; saith the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, <hi>adoravit,</hi> he adored; so most <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Translations, <hi>prostravit se,</hi> he laid himself prostrate before them; so the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Version. Now, all these words seem to import that kind of Worship, which is most proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to God alone.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if the most judicious Men are not much mistaken, such a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Worship, as these words imply, was very fit for those three Persons, whom <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Honour to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain; for they are supposed, and not without reason, to be the <hi>three</hi> Persons in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> who were then pleased to disguise themselves, and appear in the shape of Men. For to one of them, or to all three as one, did <hi>Abraham</hi> thus address himself, <hi>my Lord,</hi> and the same Lord is afterwards once and again call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is, saith <hi>Ravanellus, Nomen solius Dei proprium,</hi> a Name ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65890:26"/> communicated to any <hi>Angel,</hi> but appropriate to <hi>God</hi> alone.

            </p>
            <p>And that by this <hi>Man</hi> God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> might be meant seems the more probable, because we find him repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented under the notion of a <hi>Man</hi> by our blessed Saviour himself, and that more than once; when our Lord said, <hi>A certain man planted a vineyard,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>A certain man made a great supper,</hi> 'tis sure, that by this <hi>Certain Man,</hi> our Lord, in both these Texts, meant <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Father.</hi> And that one of those <hi>three Men,</hi> who appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> might represent God the <hi>Father</hi> is an Opinion far from being New.

            <p>Now, to sum up this Argument drawn from several Texts, as they are interpreted by many learned Men, so far as we may rely upon the Judgment of such Expositours, and that in a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65890:30"/> matter, which no man can disprove; so far we may conclude, that the God, who was pleased to shew himself to <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Moses,</hi> and some other good Men, sometimes as a <hi>Man,</hi> but more frequently as an <hi>Angel,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our blessed <hi>Saviour;</hi> and if so, 'tis evident that the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same with the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was whatever the <hi>Socinian</hi> Author foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly thinks to the contrary, more than <hi>one</hi> in Person.</p>

         <div n="6" type="section">
            <head>SECT. VI.</head>
            <p>MY second Argument, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a fair Probability in it, if the Judgment of Pious and Learned Men be any whit valuable, to prove that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person shall be this;</p>
            <p>That God, who delivered the <hi>Law</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But that God, who there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that Law, was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person.</p>
            <p>That God the <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>only</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Deity is the Doctrine of our <hi>Socinians;</hi> and consequently they stand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65890:30"/> obliged by their own Principles either to grant that the Law was given and delivered by God the <hi>Father,</hi> or else to deny its <hi>Divine</hi> Original, which, I think they do not do.</p>
            <p>The Evangelist indeed tells us,<note place="margin">Joh. <hi>1.17.</hi> Origen. in Joann.</note>
               <hi>The Law was given by Moses,</hi> but how that was, <hi>Origen</hi> tells us, who thus distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; <hi>i. e.</hi> We understand that the Law was given <hi>by Moses,</hi> but not <hi>from</hi> him.

As for <hi>Moses,</hi> 'tis said, <hi>He received the lively Oracles,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <note place="margin">Chrysost. in Joann. <hi>1.17.</hi>
               </note> he received the Law from another; and so proved not the <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator</hi> to establish and make the Law; but a <hi>Minister,</hi> an Herald, a Scribe, to receive, proclaim and write it. So that <hi>Ebion,</hi> that pestilent Heretick, had no reason to think <hi>Moses,</hi> who is said to have given the Law, to be upon that score, a greater Man than <hi>Christ.</hi>

            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65890:31"/>
            <p>But although the first Promulgation and delivery of this Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> cannot possibly be ascribed unto <hi>Moses;</hi> yet it seems very clearly to be attributed unto <hi>Angels.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul, For if the word spoken by Angels was sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,</hi>

                  <hi>Coel. Rhod.

Thus <hi>Trismegistus</hi> Fathered his Laws upon <hi>Mercury; Draco</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> theirs upon <hi>Minerva; Zamolxis,</hi> his upon <hi>Vesta; Plato,</hi> his upon <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo; Numa,</hi> his upon <hi>Egeria,</hi> &amp;c. Now, that <hi>Divine</hi> honour, which they sought for their Laws, ours undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath, as being infallibly the Law of <hi>God,</hi> or, which is all one, the Law of <hi>Christ,</hi> that glorious Lawgiver, with whom those of this World,<note place="margin">Seneca E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. <hi>9.</hi>
               </note> whom <hi>Seneca</hi> mentions for the wisest, <hi>Solon, Lycurgus, Zaleucus, Charondas,</hi> &amp;c. are not once to be named.</p>
            <p>Now, to sum up this Argument, since the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was certainly given by a <hi>God,</hi> and since he who gave the

            <p>And indeed that the <hi>second</hi> Person in the <hi>Trinity</hi> should deliver the Law, seems the more probable, because he was the Person already designed in after-times to explain and fulfil the Law, and to call Men to an account for it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Obedience to it, and to punish the Transgressions of it.</p>
            <p>But because these two Arguments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only probable and grounded upon the <hi>Opinion</hi> of Men, who are subject to mistakes, will not satisfy our <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Author, that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was more than <hi>One</hi> in Person; I shall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his Errour, and to prove the same Truth with the greatest cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, add 2 Arguments more, which I take to be clear Demonstrations, as being grounded upon the express, plain and infallible Word of God.</p>

            <p>TO prove against this <hi>Socinian</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person, my first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which I take to be convincing and unanswerable by any Man who believes the Scripture, shall be this;</p>
            <p>That God, who created the World was the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But that God who created the World, was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person.</p>
            <p>To confirm the <hi>major</hi> Proposition I need not name any <hi>Text,</hi> nor cite any <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> because I suppose that our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> will readily grant its Truth; and if they will, the Truth of the <hi>minor</hi> Proposition will be very easily proved. That God the <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>only</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Deity, is the Doctrine of our <hi>Socinians,</hi> and therefore that the <hi>Father</hi> created the World they cannot deny, unless they be of the same mind with <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arist. <hi>l. 1.</hi> de Coelo.</note> who said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; it is reasonable to think that Heaven is a Substance ingenerable and incorruptible,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65890:34"/> nor dare I charge these Men with the Opinion of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who thought that Heaven and Earth were produced, <hi>ex fortuita Atomorum cohaesione,</hi> by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous Concourse and Union of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes; nor with that of <hi>Strato Lampsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenus,</hi> who imagined, that Heaven and Earth were from Eternity; <hi>suapte na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, vi ac potestate,</hi> of themselves, their own nature, strength and power. These Opinions being so very absurd and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, I shall take it for granted, that the Creation of the World by God the <hi>Father,</hi> is one Article of our <hi>Socinians</hi> Creed.</p>
            <p>And if it be so indeed, it should be a second Article of their Creed, that there are more Persons than <hi>one</hi> in the Godhead, if we can find one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son more, besides the <hi>Father,</hi> by whom the World was created. And such a Person hath St. <hi>John</hi> helped us to; for thus he writes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2.</note>
               <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God;</hi> and his Deity he proves by this undeniable Argument. <hi>By him all things were made,</hi> &amp;c. The Words are so very plain, so uncapable of any <hi>Figurative</hi> or any other tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sense, that 'tis very strange that any Man of common Reason should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65890:35"/> to divert them from their literal Meaning, and refer them to any thing else but the <hi>first</hi> Creation.</p>
            <p>And the rather, if to this Testimony of St. <hi>John,</hi> we add that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith of Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.</note>
               <hi>By him were all things created, which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, things visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,</hi> &amp;c. an Expression which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Universe, and in most plain words, which cannot be eluded by any Pretence of <hi>Metaphors</hi> or <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymies,</hi> asserts our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> to be the Creatour of Heaven and Earth, and all things in both.</p>
            <p>I know that our <hi>Socinians</hi> do what they can to defeat the Force of that Argument, which we draw from these Texts, to prove the Divinity of our blessed Saviour; and to that end they pretend that the Creation here ascribed to Christ, is not the <hi>old</hi> Creation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Moses;</hi> but that <hi>new</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they call it; that Renovation or Reformation of the World, which was introduced by Christ during his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode here below, and afterwards car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by his Apostles according to his Command. But this Cavil is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, so inconsistent with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of these Texts, so contrary to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65890:35"/> general Judgment of the best Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters; that no Man could offer to pretend it, were not his Reason blinded with Prejudice; were he not wedded, or rather enslaved to that Party of Men who have entertained that dangerous Opinion, which these Texts being understood in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, natural and necessary Sense, do most clearly confute and overthrow.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>John</hi> saith of Christ, <hi>By him were all things made, and without him was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made;</hi> if this be true, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it is, then the Beasts of the Earth, the Fishes of the Sea, the Fowls of Heaven, Plants, Vegetables, Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the Creatures of Christ; But could any of these be concerned in that <hi>new</hi> Creation, which is pretended? If not, the <hi>old</hi> Creation must here be meant as the Effect and Workmanship of Christ.</p>
            <p>But if our <hi>Socinians</hi> shall object and say, that St. <hi>John,</hi> by <hi>All things</hi> created by Christ, meant not <hi>All Creatures,</hi> but all those <hi>Institutions,</hi> all matters whatsoever, which any way related to the whole <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Gospel; let them consider what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>By him all things were created, which are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and which are in Earth, things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65890:36"/> and invisible;</hi> and then he instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces particularly in the several Degrees and <hi>Orders,</hi> of Angels, <hi>Thrones Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers;</hi> from which words 'tis evident, that <hi>Angels</hi> are the Creatures of Christ, but when did he make them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> indeed, describing the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, makes no express mention of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> nor of the precise time, wherein they were created; for that reason St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>August. de Incarnat. Verbi,</hi> l. 1. c. 6.</note>
               <hi>Quando creati sint Angeli, non satis in manifesto distinguitur;</hi> when Angels were created, is no where clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered. But although the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual time of this Creation cannot be certainly determined, yet several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are made about it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>August. de Civ. Dei,</hi> l. 11. c. 32.</note> St. <hi>Austin</hi> mentions some who thought the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were created, <hi>ante coelum &amp; terram,</hi> before Heaven and Earth. So thought <hi>Plato,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plato in Timaeo.</note> who imagined that the Angels whom he called, <hi>Deos Juniores,</hi> Junior Gods, were of a far longer standing than Heaven and Earth. But the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Pineda</hi> is much more probable,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>eatos esse An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos,</hi> the Angels were created together with the corporeal World. And for this saying he cited <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>

                  <hi>Epiphan.</hi> tom 2. l. 2. h. 65.</note>
               <hi>unà cum coelo &amp; terra creati quoque sunt Angeli,</hi> Angels
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65890:36"/> also were created <hi>together</hi> with Heaven and Earth. And indeed it is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and the general Opinion of the Interpreters, that Angels were made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very <hi>first</hi> day of the Creation; and Perhaps, for that reason might they be stiled, <hi>The Stars of the morning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 38.7.</note> as being such Glorious and such Early Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Now then, since the <hi>Angels,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as the Creatures of Christ, were certainly made in the very Infancy of the World: What Concern could they have after so many Ages, in that <hi>new</hi> Creation, which our <hi>Socinians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, allowing our Lord no hand in the <hi>old</hi> one? 'Tis sure, that the <hi>good Angels</hi> did <hi>need</hi> no Renovation; and 'tis as sure, that for the <hi>evil Angels</hi> there was none <hi>intended.</hi> So that we may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that Angels were created by Christ, he means the first or <hi>old</hi> Creation, because the <hi>new</hi> one concerned them not. And the truth is, if they extend this <hi>new</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Angels, 'tis but a <hi>new Invention</hi> of their own, 'tis but an, <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> a Creature of their own Creating.</p>
            <p>But to sum up this Argument, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from several plain Texts, that Angels, as well as all other inferiour Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65890:37"/> were created by Christ; and 'tis clear that this whole Work of Creation was perfectly finished within six days; and that many Ages before our Lord's Incarnation, the time to which the <hi>new</hi> Creation must be referred; and in this new Creation, no <hi>Angel,</hi> no <hi>Creature,</hi> save only <hi>Man,</hi> was any way concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it must follow by an undeniable consequence, that those Texts which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to our blessed Saviour, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, must be understood of the <hi>first</hi> Creation, wherein our Lord had an equal hand with his Father. And since Creation is a work of that Infinite Power, whereof no Creature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it doth necessarily prove, that Christ, who had, and exercised such an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Power, was not a <hi>mere Man,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> most <hi>High;</hi> and since the Creatour of the World was the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> our Lord being that Creatour, and a Person distinct from his Father, we may infallibly conclude that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person, tho' this <hi>Socinian</hi> Scribler be of another mind. But I shall yet urge one Argument more.</p>

            <p>MY last Argument, which I think sufficient to convince this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Author, that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was and is more than <hi>one</hi> in Person, shall be this;</p>
            <p>That God, who spake to and by the Prophets of the Jewish Church, was the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> But that God, who spake to and by those Prophets, was more than <hi>one</hi> in Person.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> Proposition is so evident, that it needs no great Proof; 'tis very usual with the Prophets to tell us,<note place="margin">

               <hi>and in divers manners, spake in time past to the Father by the Prophets.</hi> And again, <hi>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of God.</hi> That by this Lord and this God,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> to whom the Scriptures are here ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are to understand God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> must needs be the belief of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> since they acknowledge no other Person in the Deity, and yet own the Divine Authority of our Bibles, except some Texts, which do clearly make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65890:38"/>
            <p>That the Scriptures are the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oracles of God, and that God the <hi>Father</hi> spake to and by the Prophets, being granted by our <hi>Socinians;</hi> we shall enquire whether he who spake to and by the Prophets, were God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>only,</hi> or some <hi>other</hi> Person too.

            <head>SECT. IX.</head>
            <p>IN his next Page, this Author makes this demand, wherein there lyeth an Argument, such as it is, against the Divinity of Christ. <hi>How can be be God himself, who truly is the Son of God? If he be the Son only, 'tis plain that he is not the Father also, who alone is God;</hi> so he, to which I shall reply in four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Man doth here again, <hi>petere principium,</hi>— he takes that for granted, which we <hi>deny,</hi> and he can never <hi>prove;</hi> I mean that the <hi>Father alone</hi> is God; and upon that false Supposition he grounds that Argument, whereby he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65890:39"/> would prove that Christ is not God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas this Man saith that the <hi>Son</hi> cannot be the <hi>Father,</hi> we easily grant it, for we do not only <hi>allow,</hi> but can <hi>prove</hi> a distinction of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Man doth in effect, affirm that Christ cannot possibly be God, for this Reason, because he is the <hi>Son</hi> of God. But what hinders? The <hi>Son</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> is a <hi>Man,</hi> and why may not the <hi>Son</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> as well be a <hi>God?</hi> There is indeed this difference in the case; the Son of Man is <hi>another</hi> Man, but the Son of God is not <hi>another</hi> God, but a <hi>God</hi> he is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas this Author makes this demand: <hi>How can he be God himself, who is no other than the Son of God?</hi> I shall now retort this Argument, and prove that our Saviour is most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the true God by that very reason, for which this Man saith, in effect, that he cannot be so. For, this Question of his, <hi>How can he be a God, who is no other than the Son of God?</hi> Implieth a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that he is so, or an <hi>Impossibility</hi> that he should be so.</p>
            <p>My present Argument then to prove that Christ is God, shall be this: God he is, and must be, because he is the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65890:40"/>
               <hi>Son</hi> of God; a Son in that <hi>peculiar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, wherein none else ever was, or ever can be so. And, for that reason, doth St. <hi>John,</hi> whose design it was, as well by <hi>that Title</hi> as by <hi>other Arguments,</hi> to prove the Deity of Christ, tell us, that our Lord stiled himself, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God's <hi>only begotton</hi> Son, a Title, which doth clearly distinguish him from all other Sons, either by <hi>Creation</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,</hi> and advance him infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them; nay, our Lord's own filial relation to God, in respect of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Incarnation, is not so sublime, as to deserve this glorious Title, and to denominate him, <hi>the begotten,</hi> much less the <hi>only</hi> begotten Son of God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ravanell. in verbo gigno.</note>For to beget a Son, if Judicious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks be not mistaken, is this, <hi>ex sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia sua sibi similem producere,</hi> it is for a Man out of his own substance to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce another like himself, consisting of an humane Body and a rational Soul; a Body compleat in all his Parts, and a Soul endued with all those Powers and Faculties which are Essential to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Accordingly 'tis said of <hi>Adam, He begat a Son in his own likeness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3.</note> and so do all Men else; they multiply themselves, they propagate their own image, their Sons are like them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65890:40"/> in the external shape and form of their Bodies, but always in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, order and situation of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if Nature be not accidentally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in her Operation.</p>
            <p>And for this reason,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Basil. M. adv. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom.</hi> l. 2. p. 62.</note> St. <hi>Basil</hi> the Great defines a Father thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Father is he, who is to another the Original of being in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like his own. And hence <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells, that to beget is this in general, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; it is to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one's self, and so an Animal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth an Animal, a Plant brings forth a Plant, a Man begets a Man, every Creature one of its own kind.</p>
            <p>Now then, if this be so amongst all <hi>Creatures,</hi> much more must it be so with <hi>God,</hi> if that of the <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poet be true,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Horat.</hi> l. 4. ode 4.</note> who saith, <hi>Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum, virtus;</hi> if he who begets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth derive and communicate his own Nature, with all its <hi>Essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> and <hi>Natural Perfections</hi> to him who is begotten; then, I think that in the strict and proper Sense of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our blessed Lord, considered in his <hi>humane</hi> Nature, cannot well be called the <hi>begotten</hi> Son of God.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65890:41"/>
            <p>'Its true, Christ as <hi>Man,</hi> was and is the <hi>Son</hi> of God; but not by an Act of proper <hi>Generation,</hi> for God did not, and indeed, could not communicate to the <hi>humanity</hi> of his Son all those Excellent and <hi>Essential Perfections,</hi> which are found in, and proper to his own <hi>Deity,</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is <hi>Eternal, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Immense;</hi> but the <hi>Son</hi> as <hi>Man,</hi> is not, could not be so. And since the entire Nature of God was not, could not be communicated to Christ in his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Nature of every Father is to every begotten Son; I think, we may safely say, that our Lord, as <hi>Man,</hi> in the usual and proper Sense of that Term, cannot be rightly called the Son of God by <hi>Generation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> mentioning the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Christ, tells us that he was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>i. e.</hi> not <hi>genitus,</hi> but <hi>factus,</hi> not <hi>begotten,</hi>

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.</note> but <hi>made</hi> of a Woman. The Prophet fore-telling the same thing, words it thus, <hi>The Lord hath created a new thing,</hi> But what new thing was that? <hi>A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall compass a Man,</hi> the framing of our Lord's humane Nature in a Virgin's Womb is here expressed as an Act, not of <hi>Generation,</hi> but of <hi>Creation;</hi> not an immediate and <hi>proper</hi> Creation out of nothing; but as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body is said to be created, because formed, <hi>ex materia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habili,</hi> of the dust of the ground, which was so unlikely and untoward matter; so our Lord's Body, being made of the <hi>Virgin</hi>'s Substance alone, without the usual concurrence of Man, may well be said in the same Sense to be <hi>created</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And if our Lord, as Man, cannot in strict propriety of Speech, be called, <hi>the Begotten,</hi> much less can he in the same Capacity be called, the <hi>only begotten</hi> Son of God. We grant indeed, that our Lord in an <hi>allusive</hi> and <hi>metaphorical</hi> Sense, is stiled, the <hi>begotten Son of God,</hi> by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65890:42"/> vertue of his <hi>Resurrection;</hi> the <hi>Grave</hi> being likened to a <hi>Womb,</hi> and the Person <hi>raised</hi> by the Power of God to a second Life, being represented as one that is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>born.</hi> To this purpose St. <hi>Peter</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets that of the Psalmist,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Thou art my Son this day,</hi> the day of his Resurrection, <hi>have I begotten thee.</hi> But in this impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sense, our Lord is not an <hi>only</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son; for God hath already had, and hereafter will have many more such begotten Sons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36.</note> who are called <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, being the Children of the Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, should we allow that in this <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Sense, our Lord might be called the <hi>begotten</hi> Son of God, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his <hi>Conception</hi> in the Womb of a Virgin, by the wonderful Power of God; yet neither in this respect can he be called an <hi>only</hi> begotten Son; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no Man else was ever conceived and born of a Virgin; yet there was another Man formed, produced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened by as great an Act of God's Omnipotence, and that gave him a right to this Title,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.38.</note>
               <hi>Adam, the Son of God.</hi> And if the Wonder of our Lord's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Birth might give him the Title of God's begotten Son, I see no reason, why the wonder of <hi>Adam</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65890:42"/> should not render him capable of the same Title too.</p>
            <p>Nay more, the making of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body seems to be a more immediate and greater Act of Omnipotence, than the making of the Body of Christ; as Christ was, as to Men, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Father;</hi> so was <hi>Adam,</hi>

               </gap>, without <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> too. I know, the Earth is stiled, <hi>Magna Mater,</hi> the Great Mother, but not of <hi>Men;</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Terrigena Fratres,</hi> the Giants born of the Earth are but Poetical <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> The dust of the Earth, was not so likely matter to make <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body, as the Virgin's Flesh and Blood were to make our Lord's; in the Creation of <hi>Adam,</hi> God did all, the dull Earth was wholly Passive; but doubtless, towards the Incarnation of Christ, the blessed Virgin being first impregnated by the Holy Ghost, did as much as other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are wont to do; there was from her a Vital and Active Concurrence with that Holy Spirit; who was, not <hi>Semen,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> it self; but <hi>loco Seminis,</hi> instead of the Seed, the Virgin's Womb being the Soil, in and out of which our Lord's Body, that Sacred Embryo, was formed, enlivened, nourished and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for its Nativity.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65890:43"/>
            <p>Now then, if the <hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> were at least as wonderful a Work as the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> since they were both effected by the same Almighty Power; and yet the one in the nature of the thing seems somewhat more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult than the other; methinks if the easier Work, that of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> be sufficient to denominate our <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>begotten Son of God,</hi> as being incarnated by his Power; then the harder Work, that of <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Creation,</hi> may as well give him a right to the same Title, as being created by an higher Act of the same Omnipotence.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithstanding all this, 'tis evident that our Lord is called, and therefore really is, the <hi>only begotten Son of God;</hi> and since he cannot be so called, nor so be, as he is <hi>Man,</hi> he must be so called and so be, as and because he is <hi>God,</hi> even by an <hi>eternal Generation.</hi> For 'tis evident from a variety of Texts, that this Son of God had a being from Eternity; for St. <hi>John</hi> saith of him, <hi>In the beginning was the word, i. e.</hi> before all time; so much doth the next Verse prove, <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> if so, then <hi>time</hi> it self is one of his Creatures. St. <hi>Paul</hi> also tells us, <hi>All things were made by him and for him,</hi> and thence he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65890:43"/> infers his Omnipotence and Eternity, and tells us in the very next words, <hi>He is before all things, and by him all things consist;</hi> certainly, 'tis not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for any Man to invent words more plain, and express to convince us, that our blessed Redeemer is in reality in a literal and proper sense, the great <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> and <hi>Upholder</hi> of the Universe; which are such sublime Titles, as could by no means belong unto him, were he not indeed the Eternal Son of God.</p>
            <p>And if our blessed Saviour be, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he is, the <hi>eternal Son</hi> of God, then must he needs be of the same <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and Essence with God his <hi>Father;</hi> he must be God, as his Father is; Why else doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> stile him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</note>
               <hi>The express image of his Person, and the brightness of his Glory?</hi> We see that every Creature communicates its own Nature to its own Issue; an Horse to its Colt, a Sheep to its Lamb, and every Man to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son. And if through the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Concurrence of God's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, it must be thus with all sorts of Creatures; if a Sheep beget a Sheep, if a Man beget a Man, we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that since a <hi>God</hi> begets a <hi>Son,</hi> he begets such a Son, as is in all respects like himself; a Son, who is a God, but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65890:44"/> though another Person, yet not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God. For the Generation of the Son is nothing else, but the full and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Communication of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to him; and because that Nature is Infinite and Indivisible, it must be wholly communicated without any mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of the Deity. So that <hi>three Persons,</hi> being of one and the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the same not only in <hi>kind,</hi> but <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> are but <hi>one</hi> God; so is the Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause eternally begotten of the Father; and so is the Holy Ghost, because eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally proceeding from both.</p>
            <p>Now, since our blessed Saviour is therefore God, because he is proved the <hi>Eternal,</hi> and is called the <hi>only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God;</hi> How came this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to make this demand; <hi>How can he be God, who is no other than the Son of God?</hi> Why might he not as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, How can he be a <hi>Man,</hi> who is no other than the <hi>Son</hi> of Man? But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this Man's demand with another, I ask, How can he, who is the eternal, natural and only begotten Son of God, How can he in that Capacity, be any thing else but God? For he cannot be, as yet he is proved, either the eternal and natural, or, as he is called, the Only begotten Son of God, as he is Man.</p>

            <p>This heretical Opinion hath been just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by <hi>Councils, Fathers, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and many other pious and learned <hi>Divines,</hi> who have written in defence of the contrary Doctrine, and lived and died in the Faith of the glorious <hi>Trinity.</hi> But, alas! the whole number of these Excellent Persons must now truckle and submit their Judgments to this grand <hi>Theologue,</hi> the <hi>Clock-maker.</hi> But that they and we may do so, this <hi>Mechanick</hi> and <hi>Apron Divine</hi> must produce better Arguments to disprove the Divinity of Christ, than any of his Predecessours or Modern Abetters as yet have done;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65890:45"/> now, to make good as he thinks, this heretical Proposition, <hi>That Christ is not the true God,</hi> he takes a double course;</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Man <hi>propounds</hi> some <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> such as they are, to disprove the Deity of Christ. 2. He endeavours as well as he can, to <hi>answer</hi> those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are commonly urged by our Orthodox Divines to prove it.</p>
            <p>The Arguments which this mighty <hi>Disputant</hi> urgeth to disprove the Deity of Christ are these Three; 1. <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not God, because he hath a God above him.</hi> 2. <hi>Because what he did, he did by a power received from God.</hi> 3. <hi>Because God and he are plainly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished;</hi> and to make good each of these, he cites several Texts, which yet will do him but little Service. And by the way let me tell the Reader, that this Man is but a sorry Artist, if the <hi>works</hi> of his <hi>hand,</hi> in his own Craft, be not far better than this of his <hi>head,</hi> if he do not use his common <hi>Tools</hi> much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his <hi>Pen;</hi> and if the Motions of his <hi>Springs,</hi> Wheels and Clocks, be not more <hi>regular</hi> and true than the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and Assertions of his <hi>Book.</hi> And now let us examine them one by one as they lie in order.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65890:45"/>1. The first Argument which this Man urgeth to disprove the Deity of Christ, is this, <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not the true God, because he hath a God above him:</hi> This Argument, if put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form, must run thus;</p>
            <p>That Person, who hath a God above him, cannot himself be the true God. But Christ is a Person, who hath a God above him. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He himself cannot be the True God.</p>
            <p>The force of the <hi>major</hi> Proposition depends upon this undoubted Truth; namely, that the true God is the most High and <hi>Supreme</hi> Being; and he who is the <hi>Supreme,</hi> can have none <hi>above</hi> him; if therefore Christ have a God <hi>above</hi> him, he is not the <hi>Supreme</hi> Being, and consequently not the <hi>True God;</hi> that is all the strength of this <hi>major</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The truth of the <hi>minor</hi> Proposition, Which saith that <hi>Christ hath a God above him,</hi> is evident from several Texts; St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Head of Christ is God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.</note> and our Lord himself doth freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thus;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29.</note>
               <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> and if he be greater, then must he needs be above him.</p>
            <p>This Argument seems to our Author to be so clear and strong, that he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65890:46"/> to say, <hi>'Tis evident beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> and yet I shall make bold to contradict it; for 'tis grounded upon a <hi>fallacy;</hi> it proceeds, <hi>à dicto secundùm quid ad dictum simpliciter,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Head of Christ is God;</hi> and when our Lord saith, <hi>My Father is greater than I:</hi> These and the like Texts speak of Christ as he is, the <hi>Mediator betwixt God and Man,</hi> as he is the <hi>Man</hi> Christ Jesus; and who doubts but God is greater than the best of Men?</p>
            <p>And that these Words of Christ, <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> are not to be understood, <hi>simpliciter,</hi> simply, absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upon all accounts whatsoever; but, <hi>secundùm quid,</hi> in a Relative and restrained Sense, we have the Judgment of far better Interpreters than our <hi>Clock-maker,</hi> or any of his Abetters, can with any modesty pretend to be. There is a twofold relation to Christ, wherein these words are thought to stand: 1. As he is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> 2. As he is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Some think that these words were spoken by Christ in relation to himself, as being the <hi>Son</hi> of God, <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> But how so? Great St. <hi>Basil</hi> answers,<note place="margin">

The substance of which Words is this; namely, that God the <hi>Father</hi> is said to be greater than the Son in regard of his <hi>Paternity,</hi> as he is the <hi>Original</hi> and Fountain of the Deity; as he is the only Person, who commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates the Divine Essence to the Son.

            <p>In the same Sense doth St. <hi>Austin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret these Words of Christ,<note place="margin">Augustin. de Fide &amp; Symb. <hi>tom. 3. c. 9.</hi>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65890:47"/>
               <hi>Austin</hi> gives this reason, <hi>Quia Filius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Patri quòd est;</hi> because the <hi>Son</hi> oweth his very <hi>Being</hi> to the Father.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Tertullian</hi> useth this Text as an Argument to prove the distinction of Persons betwixt the <hi>Father</hi> and the Son; <hi>Pater alius à filio, dum filio major,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> must needs be distinguished from the <hi>Son,</hi> since he is <hi>greater</hi> than he; and upon what score he is greater, he seems to intimate in his next Expression, <hi>Alius qui generat, alius qui generatur,</hi> he who doth beget is one, and he who is begotten is another. The same account is given us by St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> as <hi>Erasmus</hi> cites him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Erasm. in Joh.</hi> 14. v. 28.</note> why the Father is greater than the Son; he is so, <hi>Ratione principii, quia à patre filius,</hi> because the <hi>Son originally</hi> received his Divine <hi>Nature</hi> from the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although the <hi>Father</hi> be supposed <hi>greater</hi> than the <hi>Son</hi> in respect of his own <hi>Paternity,</hi> and his Son's <hi>Filiation,</hi> yet upon any other account he is not so; thus must we understand that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of St. <hi>Hilary, Patrem esse majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem filio, filium tamen non esse minorem Patre;</hi> though the Father, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> as such, be greater than the Son, <hi>quà talis,</hi> as the Son, yet in other respects, the <hi>Son</hi> is no <hi>less</hi> than the <hi>Father.</hi> For, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura aequalis est Patri, &amp; in Divinis Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonis
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65890:47"/> ordo quidem est, inaequalitas non est,</hi> the Son in <hi>Nature</hi> is equal to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for though amongst the Divine Persons there be a distinction and prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Orders,</hi> yet there is no <hi>inequality.</hi> So <hi>Erasmus.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is yet another more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and indeed more probable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation given us of these words, <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> i. e. than I as being the Son of <hi>Man.</hi> 'Tis true, our Lord, as Man, was entrusted with a very large Authority here below; but when he was to leave the World, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles being sorely troubled for the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy loss of their dear Lord and Master, to revive and raise their drooping Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, he gave them this assurance, <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father;</hi> that Father of mine and yours, <hi>who is greater than I,</hi> much more able to assist you in all your Sufferings, and to supply all your Wants.</p>
            <p>And that when our Lord delivered these words, <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> he spake of himself as <hi>Man,</hi> is the general persuasion of the best Interpreters which I can meet with <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And indeed, well he might; for one would think that a Man who denieth the Deity of Christ, should be ashamed of himself and abhor his Opinion, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> so plainly tells him, that Christ <hi>being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Certainly, if it had been Robbery, our Lord must have thought it so; for, Could he who is Wisdom it self be mistaken?

            </p>
            <p>But if our Lord be indeed <hi>equal with God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, How comes our Saviour himself to tell us, <hi>My Father is greater than I?</hi> Can there be a <hi>Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and yet an <hi>Equality</hi> too?

No such matter, there is a very fair Correspondence between them, and their different Expressions are very easily reconciled, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self here tells us how.

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65890:49"/> 2. As being in the <hi>form</hi> of a <hi>Servant,</hi> and made in the likeness of <hi>Men;</hi> and from hence St. <hi>Austin</hi> took just occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve this Riddle thus, <hi>In forma servi,</hi>

            <p>And now 'tis time to tell this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that the <hi>major</hi> Proposition, couched in his Argument, which runs thus, <hi>That Person who hath a God above him, is not, cannot himself be God;</hi> being absolutely and universally understood, is utterly false; and to make it true, this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is required, That Person, who hath a God above him, cannot himself be the true God, and <hi>nothing else;</hi> but if he may be <hi>something else,</hi> which is <hi>less</hi> than <hi>God,</hi> which is our Saviour's Case, then must he have a God <hi>above</hi> him, and yet himself be the <hi>true God</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>That our Lord is indeed <hi>somewhat else</hi> than <hi>God,</hi> this Author will not deny, for he asserts that he is a <hi>Man,</hi> and no more; but since by clear Texts and infallible Arguments, he is proved to be <hi>God,</hi> our Adversary willingly grants him to be a <hi>Man;</hi> our Lord, being not <hi>only</hi> God; but Man too, might well say, in regard of that <hi>inferiour</hi> Capacity of his, <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than I;</hi> but on the other hand, in regard of his <hi>Divine</hi> Nature St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> and since he thought so, who knew very good reason for it, I see no cause why we should not think so too.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65890:51"/>
            <p>That Confession of Faith, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth under the Name of the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> delivers that Truth, which the Devil and his suborned Disputers will never be able to overthrow, when it tells us, that our Lord, <hi>As touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is equal to the Father; and inferiour to the Father, as touching his Manhood.</hi> For, though he have a God above him, considered as the Son of <hi>Man;</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as the <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> he hath none above him; for though there be betwixt the Father and the Son a <hi>Priority</hi> and a <hi>Posteriority</hi> in respect of Order; yet as there is no such thing in respect of <hi>time,</hi> so there is nothing of <hi>inequality</hi> in respect of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Essence, or any of those Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are inherent in it, and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from it.</p>
            <p>So then, if our blessed Saviour, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat <hi>else</hi> than God, may have a God <hi>above</hi> him, and yet be the <hi>true God</hi> notwithstanding; our Author's <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> Proposition being utterly false; his Conclusion, <hi>That Christ is not God,</hi> can never be true. And so much in answer to his first Argument.</p>

            <head>SECT. XI.</head>
            <p>THE second Argument which this Author urgeth against the Divinity of Christ, is this, <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not God, because what he doth, is by a Power received from God.</hi> This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument put into some form, runs thus;</p>
            <p>That Person, who acts by a Power received from God, cannot himself be God. But Christ acted by a Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ cannot be God.</p>
            <p>'Tis most certain, that he, who is God, doth always act by his own Power; his Omnipotence is not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, but it is one of those natural and essential Perfections, which belong to, and are inseparable from his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. So that whosoever acts by a borrowed Power, and such a Power only, cannot be God; and so far the <hi>major</hi> Proposition is true, and proves that <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and our Lord's <hi>Apostles,</hi> who did many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but by a Power which was not their own, but only lent them, were no more than <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65890:52"/>
            <p>But if by this <hi>minor</hi> Proposition, <hi>Christ acted by a Power received from God,</hi> this Author means (and mean so he must, if he mean any thing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) that our blessed Saviour in the time of his Incarnation wrought all his Miracles by a <hi>borrowed</hi> Power, and such a Power only, this Proposition is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly false; and the Texts which this Man cites, can never prove it true.</p>
            <p>We do easily grant the Truth of that Expression,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.</note>
               <hi>No man can do these miracles, which thou doest, except God be with him;</hi> the Text imports that no <hi>mere</hi> Man could ever do such mighty Wonders, as our Lord did, by any <hi>natural</hi> Power of his own, and without the <hi>supernatural</hi> Power of God.

            <p>We grant that those many Miracles which our blessed Saviour wrought,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65890:52"/> whilst he conversed in this lower World, were not done by any Power that was <hi>natural</hi> and properly belonging to his own <hi>Humanity,</hi> but derived from above; for, he himself tells us,<note place="margin">

               <hi>I with the finger of God cast out Devils.</hi> And that by a <hi>Divine</hi> Power he wrought all his other Miracles, the judicious Spectators easily and justly believed; so intimates the Evangelist,<note place="margin">

               <hi>When the multitude saw his miracles, they marvelled and glorified God, who had given such power unto men.</hi> Now, saith this <hi>Socinian</hi> Author, <hi>These things can in no tolerable sense be said of him, that is truly God.</hi> But can they not with very good Sense be said of him who was truly <hi>Man,</hi> as well as truly <hi>God?</hi> And of Christ as being Man, are these things written.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Son is in all things like the Father, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; he hath the self same Essence, the self same Power; and this he proves by those fore-named Words of Christ, <hi>What things soever the Father doth, these also doth the Son likewise:</hi> and from thence he thus infers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; If the <hi>Father</hi> act with Authority and Power, since the <hi>Son</hi> acts <hi>like</hi> him, he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65890:53"/> cannot be <hi>inferiour</hi> to him; <hi>i. e.</hi> in point of <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that our blessed Saviour did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed receive all his Power <hi>originally</hi> from his <hi>Father,</hi> is not to be denied; that Power which he shewed by <hi>creating</hi> the World some thousands of years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation; and that Power which he shewed by working <hi>Miracles</hi> some years after it, were both received originally from God the Father. For God the Father did by an act of eternal Generation communicate to our Lord his only begotten Son, his own entire Essence, and with it all the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to it, of which Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is one. So that we may say as <hi>Maldonate</hi> doth, <hi>Christum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maldon. in Matt.</hi> c. 28.18.</note>
               <hi>etiam quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Deus erat, potestatem omnem sicut &amp; naturam ipsam Divinam à Patre per aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Genirationem accepisse;</hi> that Christ, even as <hi>God,</hi> received all his <hi>Power,</hi> even as his <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, by his eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from his <hi>Father.</hi> And surely, the reception of that Power which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from that Nature which he received, cannot <hi>ungod</hi> our Lord, but rather prove his <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since God the Father did from Eternity communicate to his Son his own entire <hi>Essence,</hi> and with it his own
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65890:54"/>
               <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> we may justly say, that when this Son of his was pleased to take upon him the nature of Man, and in that nature to work many Miracles; the Power whereby he wrought them, though originally received from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was then his own; <hi>exercised</hi> by himself as being <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>received</hi> from himself, as being <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, this Author's second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the Divinity of Christ falls to the ground; for both his Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as he means them are utterly false; his <hi>major</hi> Proposition is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Person who acts by a Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God, cannot be God himself.</hi> But this is false, for our blessed Saviour did at once receive from his Father his <hi>Godhead</hi> and his <hi>Power</hi> too; his Power, because his Godhead, from which his Omnipotence is inseparable. Again, his <hi>minor</hi> Proposition is this. <hi>But Christ acted by a Power received from God;</hi> he means, from God the <hi>Father</hi> only. But this is false too; for our Saviour being <hi>God,</hi> acted when he became a <hi>Man,</hi> by a Power which his <hi>humanity</hi> received, not only from his <hi>Father,</hi> but from <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> also. And this I take to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient answer to, and confutation of this Man's second Argument.</p>

            <p>THis Author's third and last Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the Divinity of Christ is this, <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not God, because God and He are plainly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished;</hi> which Argument also may be put into this form;</p>
            <p>That Person who is plainly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from God, cannot be God himself. But Christ is so distinguished from God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He himself cannot be God.</p>
            <p>To prove a distinction betwixt God and Christ, this Man cites several Texts; and is so confident of the force of this present Argument, that he boldly saith, <hi>This Consideration alone of it self is a very strong Argument to prove our Lord Jesus Christ not to be really and truly God, since he is every where spoken of as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that differs as much from God, as a noble Subject differs from his Prince or King:</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>But methinks this Man should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to publish such a notorious false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to the World, which every Man who reads and observes his Bible may so easily and so evidently contradict; Can he do less than blush when he reads his own blasphemous Paper, wherein
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65890:55"/> he saith, that the Scriptures do <hi>every</hi> where speak of Christ, <hi>as a Person that differs as much from God, as a noble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject doth from his King?</hi> Our Lord is often stiled, <hi>the Son,</hi> and sometimes, <hi>the only begotten Son of God:</hi> and is the only <hi>Son</hi> of God no nearer to God his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> than a <hi>Nobleman</hi> to his <hi>Prince?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Christ thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God.</hi> But I am apt to think that it would be esteemed a <hi>great robbery,</hi> should some noble <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> claim an <hi>equality</hi> with his <hi>King.</hi> We read that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did advance <hi>Joseph</hi> to be the second Man in his Kingdom, the very Chief of all his noble Subjects; but yet he told him, <hi>In the Throne I will be greater than thou.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But, alas! 'tis this great Disputant's unhappiness, that he still argueth from a gross misapprehension of our Lord's most sacred Person, and is forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend an ill Cause, which is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a just defence by fallacious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and taking and pleading no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius Falshoods, as if they were granted
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65890:55"/> Truths. For, though we have clearly proved that Christ is <hi>truly God,</hi> yet this blind <hi>Beetle</hi> still takes him to be a <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>no</hi> more; and in that Capacity to be distinguished from God, which none of us deny. Nay more, the <hi>humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christ, though now, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>highly exalted,</hi> even above the most glorious Angels, yet being a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> doth differ more from its great <hi>Creatour</hi> than not only a <hi>noble Subject,</hi> but even the <hi>poorest Peasant</hi> differs from the <hi>greatest Prince.</hi> For though there be a mighty difference upon <hi>Civil</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts betwixt a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Beggar</hi> for a short time, yet since they natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consist of the same Materials, they will e'er long be resolved into the same Principles, and levelled to an <hi>equality</hi> in the Grave. God Almighty, in the execution of his Decrees, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of his Providence, is pleased to use Men of <hi>several</hi> Orders, even as we in casting up an Account, do use abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Counters;</hi> this Counter stands for <hi>one;</hi> that for <hi>ten;</hi> this for an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> that for a <hi>thousand;</hi> but when the Account is cast, they are all shuffled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and then there is no difference in point of value betwixt that which stood for a <hi>single unity,</hi> and that which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65890:56"/> stood for <hi>thousands.</hi> But because there is infinite distance betwixt the <hi>Deity</hi> and the <hi>Humanity,</hi> this difference can never be so reconciled, as to create any thing like an <hi>equality</hi> betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Man;</hi> and his <hi>Father</hi> being <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides that difference which is betwixt the <hi>nature</hi> of God and Christ as <hi>Man,</hi> the Scriptures teach us, there is a difference between them upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scores, I mean, in point of <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Personality;</hi> for the <hi>Father,</hi> who doth beget, is not, cannot be the same in <hi>Relation</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> with the <hi>Son,</hi> who is <hi>begotten.</hi> This distinction we own, because the Scriptures do so; and by them we prove it against the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who deny it. St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>The word was with God,</hi> if so, the <hi>Word</hi> must be <hi>one,</hi> and that God, with whom he was, must be another. Our Lord saith, <hi>I and my Father;</hi> this imports a <hi>distinction</hi> of their <hi>Persons;</hi> for were they not <hi>two,</hi> they could not be thus coupled.</p>
            <p>But although there be indeed such a distinction in point of <hi>nature</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>Man;</hi> and though there be a distinction in point of <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> betwixt God as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and Christ as his only and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally begotten <hi>Son;</hi> yet the Scriptures

            <p>In short, to name no more particular Authors, <hi>Maldonate</hi> expounding these words of Christ, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maldon. in locum.</note> tells us, <hi>Catholici quidem omnes Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiam dicebant significare;</hi> all Catholick Writers were of this persuasion, and the Context warrants it, that the Unity here intended by Christ betwixt himself and his Father is an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and consequently of <hi>Nature</hi> and Essence.</p>
            <p>And now let us review this <hi>Socinian</hi>'s Argument; <hi>Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not God,</hi> but why not? His reason is this, <hi>Because God and he are plainly distinguished.</hi> To which I answer, three things; 1. God and Christ are indeed distinguished as Christ is <hi>Man,</hi> and God his Father is not so. 2. They are indeed distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their <hi>Persons, Relations,</hi> and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Proprieties; for, the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Father; the Son is begotten, the Father is not But, 3. They are not at all distinguished in their <hi>Nature</hi> and Essence, or in any of those infinite Perfections which are inherent in it. Nor hath this Man cited
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65890:59"/> any one Text, which in these respects doth prove any inequality between them.</p>
            <p>Sure we are, that God Almighty by his Prophet stiles our Saviour thus, <hi>The Man which is my Fellow,</hi> his other self, <hi>the brightness of his Glory, the express Image of his Person:</hi> But how could Christ be God's <hi>Fellow,</hi> were he no more than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>mere Man?</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> renders this Text thus,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Virum cohaeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem mihi;</hi> i. e. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the Man who <hi>adheres</hi> and is as it were <hi>glued</hi> to me, as being <hi>one</hi> with me; the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase reads it, <hi>Socium qui similis est;</hi> God's <hi>Fellow</hi> who is <hi>like</hi> him; <hi>Virum mihi coaequalem,</hi> so <hi>Vatablus,</hi>

            <head>SECT. XIII.</head>
            <p>THIS Author having spent all his Arguments against the Divinity of Christ quite in vain, appeals as his last refuge; <hi>To that account which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give of the Person of Christ.</hi> But really that account which he thought fit to gather from thence and present to his Reader, is a very lame one: For, he hath only collected and culled out a great number of such Texts, as serve to prove what none of us deny, that Christ was really a Man. But in his great Prudence he quite leaves out of his Account all those Texts which call and prove him God, though there be many that do so; only he boldly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, 1. <hi>That 'tis, not said in Scripture so much as once, that Christ is God most High.</hi> Nor, 2. <hi>That he is one of that Sacred Three, which do constitute or make up the true Godhead.</hi> So he. To both which Clauses we answer thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the first we answer, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scriptures do no where say, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> in express Terms, that Christ is God <hi>most High;</hi> yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth say in clear Terms full as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65890:60"/> much as that amounts unto. St. <hi>John,</hi> saith of him, <hi>This is the true God;</hi> and if he be the <hi>true</hi> God, he must also be the <hi>most High,</hi> for the true God is but One.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the second we answer likewise thus, Though the Scriptures do not use this Expression, <hi>Christ is one of that Sacred Th ee, which do constitute or make up the Godhead;</hi> yet it doth deliver the Truth intended by these words, in Terms equivalent: So doth St. <hi>John,</hi> when he tells us,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7.</note>
               <hi>There are Three that bear record in Heaven,</hi> and those Three he names thus, <hi>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these Three are One;</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>one Thing,</hi> and that one Thing is God. The same Three Persons with the change of his own Title, doth our Lord mention in his prescribed Form of Baptism, where he names, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> by whom we must needs understand the <hi>Three</hi> Glorious Persons in the <hi>Godhead;</hi> for if not, if the Father <hi>alone</hi> were God, then are we commanded to Baptize at once; <hi>In the Name,</hi> i. e. <hi>at the Command,</hi> or, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>into the Name,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and Worship both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> too, which cannot be.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65890:61"/>
            <p>And methinks 'tis very strange that any Man of common Sense and Reason should read these Texts, and yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily assert, that the Scriptures do not so much as once affirm, that Christ, who is here called, the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> being joyned with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in both these and other Texts, is not, <hi>One of that Sacred Three, which do constitute or make up the Deity,</hi> as this Author words it.</p>
            <p>But from hence this Man proceeds to consider, <hi>The Primitive Confessions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christ:</hi> And here he tells us, 1. Negatively, what they were not. 2. Positively, what they were. 1. This Author tells us <hi>Negatively,</hi> that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Confessions concerning Christ were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not that Jesus our Lord was equal to the Father in all kind of Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> And yet St. <hi>Thomas</hi> confessed him in these words,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28.</note>
               <hi>My Lord and my God;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> confessed him to be, <hi>God blessed for ever,</hi>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.</note> and tells us, <hi>That he thought it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Indefinitely and universally equal without any restriction or limitation; for, he who doth equal God in any <hi>one</hi> of his Infinite Perfections, must equal him in <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:65890:61"/>2. <hi>Not that Christ was God of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Father, as he was Man of the Substance of his Mother:</hi> And yet the Scriptures acknowledge him to be the <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> a Title, which could never have justly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, had he not been <hi>begotten</hi> of his <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>Substance,</hi> and been no more than a <hi>Man born</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Author tells us <hi>positively</hi> thus, <hi>All that those first Confessions do contain, was this; That he was the Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour of the World:</hi> And then he closes his Discourse upon this Head with this Remark; <hi>Here is no Trinity in Unity, no God-man, no Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical Union so much as mentioned, nor any of those hard and cramping Names, with which the Church of God hath been since perplexed.</hi> To which we answer thus,</p>
            <p>This short Confession of St. <hi>Peter, Thou art Christ the Son of the living God,</hi> contains more in it than is expressed in those few words wherein it is delivered, and so needs an Explication. Those brief Commands of the Moral Law, <hi>Thou shalt do no murder,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.16.</note>
               <hi>thou shalt not commit adultery,</hi> do forbid such other sins, and require such Duties as in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65890:62"/> Terms of the Law are not named. And accordingly our blessed Saviour, who best understood the meaning of his own Precepts, did give a larger Sense of these Commands than that, wherein the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors of the Jewish Church did ever understand them. And as our Lord saw it necessary to amplify and enlarge the short commands of the Moral Law, because the full extent of them was not apprehended by the Jewish Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; even so the Pious, Learned and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Fathers of the Primitive Church, convened in several Councils; thought it fit, and indeed very necessary, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and illustrate this short Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, relating to our blessed Saviour; because it was misunderstood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much restrained, was made an occasion of Heresie, and that by Men of Parts and Learning, but too much wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their own Opinions.</p>
            <p>This Confession of Christ, <hi>Thou art the Son of God;</hi> these Men referred only to our Lord's <hi>Temporal</hi> Conception and Birth, as being effected by the miraculous Power of God, enabling a Virgin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common course of nature, to conceive and bear a Son; so they count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Lord to be no otherwise the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> than as he was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi>

            <p>Now, to obviate and prevent the growth of this <hi>Heretical</hi> and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinion, the learned Fathers, who lived in that Age, wherein this Heresie began to spread, being zealous for God's truth and our Lord's honour, drew up an Explication of this short Confession: I mean, the <hi>Nicene</hi> or <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Creed, wherein there is nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in relation either to the Person of Christ, or the Holy Ghost, but what is very agreeable to, and clearly warranted by the word of God.</p>
            <p>And if all the matters declared in this <hi>Creed,</hi> compiled at first by judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pious Men, and still owned by the Catholick Church, may be proved by such and such Texts; then must we conclude, that this Creed is not, in its <hi>substance,</hi> a <hi>new</hi> Confession; but only an <hi>illustration</hi> or Explication of the <hi>old</hi> ones; it doth not impose upon us the belief of any new Doctrines, but tends to secure,<note place="margin">

               <hi>the faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and to preserve the Professours of it from those dangerous Heresies, which arose in former times, and are now revived in this unhappy Age of ours.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:65890:63"/>
            <p>But although this <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and that of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> as larger Confessions of the Christian Faith, were designed by very good Men, and to such very good ends; yet they cannot escape the undeserved censure of this impertinent scribler, who, having transcribed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>short</hi> Confessions, recorded in the Gospel; immediately, in contempt of these <hi>larger</hi> Confessions, subjoyns these words, <hi>Here's no Trinity in Unity.</hi> And yet St. <hi>John</hi> very plainly saith, <hi>There are Three, that bear record in Heaven; and these Three are One.</hi> If there be <hi>Three,</hi> there's an acknowledgment of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> and if these <hi>Three</hi> be <hi>One,</hi> there's an acknowledgment of the <hi>Unity;</hi> and since St. <hi>John</hi> doth own the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> why should not our <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>we</hi> do as much.</p>
            <p>Again, this <hi>Apron Schoolman,</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the short Confessions of the Gospel, saith, <hi>Here is no God-man:</hi> And yet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a far better both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Disputant,</hi> in one place stiles our Lord,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi>

            <p>IN his next Page this Author gives us an account of, <hi>The undoubted Faith, on which the salvation of all Christians doth depend,</hi> and tells us, that it is no other than this. <hi>That we believe that Jesus is the Son of God. That we confess with our mouth, and believe in our heart, that God raised him from the dead,</hi> and some other particulars, which he names.</p>
            <p>But then he adds these words, <hi>The Scriptures no where injoyn us to believe, on pain of Damnation, either that Jesus is God most high, or that he is both God and Man, or that he was eternally begotten of the Father.</hi> It seems these are no Articles of this Man's Faith, though they are and ought to be of mine.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65890:66"/>
            <p>But let this Man tell us, whether we are not obliged to believe whatever God hath revealed for a Truth; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, whatever the Proposition be, if God assert it, though we know not how it should be so, yet we must not doubt it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10.</note> for St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>He that believes not, makes God a liar,</hi> and surely there is danger enough in doing so. Indeed, it is not necessary for us, to know, in order to our Salvation, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Scriptures have delivered for a Truth; but there are some <hi>Fundamental</hi> Truths, which we are obliged to know and believe under the penalty of <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> for, our Saviour himself hath said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16.</note>
               <hi>He, that believes not, shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that these <hi>three Propositions,</hi> which this Man counts unnecessary, <hi>That Jesus is God most high. That he is both God and Man. That he was eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his Father,</hi> are indeed <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Truths, the belief whereof is generally necessary to Salvation to all such persons, as have been taught them; hath been, I think, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. So much may be inferred from those <hi>Antient Creeds,</hi> which have been and still are received, as short <hi>Systemes</hi> of such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65890:66"/> as are the <hi>grounds</hi> of saving <hi>faith,</hi> and the <hi>foundations</hi> of Christian <hi>practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> doth contain in it all the Articles of Faith, which are necessary to Salvation; and since it is short, probably very few, if any, but such; I think no Man will doubt, who believes that this <hi>Creed</hi> was first written by those <hi>inspired men,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards delivered, as abridgments of the Christian Faith, to the several Churches which they had planted</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed and that of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> were drawn up in after times, only as <hi>Comments</hi> upon, and <hi>Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of, that of the Apostles; and especially those Articles, which were then opposed by several <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and none more than those, which relate to our blessed Saviours <hi>Person,</hi> his <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> being denied by some, his <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> by others; some affirming that he was a Man only, <hi>putativè,</hi> not in <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> but in <hi>Appearance;</hi> others saying that he took upon him Real <hi>flesh,</hi> but without a <hi>Soul;</hi> his <hi>Deity</hi> instead of a <hi>Rational Soul</hi> enlivening, informing, and acting his Humane Body.</p>
            <p>Now, those Articles, which concern our Lords Sacred Person, in the <hi>Apostles</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:65890:67"/> Creed run thus, <hi>I believe in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary. Here we have an express Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Lords <hi>humanity,</hi> for <hi>Mary's</hi> Son must needs be a Man. Here is also a very fair Testimony of our Lords <hi>Divinity,</hi> since he is stiled God's only, or, <hi>Only begotten Son.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some, by a gross mistake, thought him capable of this Title, as he was <hi>Man,</hi> because he was the only person, that was ever Conceived immediately by the power of God, and born of a Virgin; they did not think this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, as it runs in the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> to be a sufficient proof of our Lords <hi>Divinity.</hi> And, for that reason, the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> explains it thus, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God; God of God, light of light, very God of God; begotten, not made; being of one substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by whom all things were made:</hi> and then our Lords <hi>Humanity</hi> is thus expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>who for us men and for our Salvation came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and was made Man.</hi> The same Article in the Creed of <hi>Athanasius</hi> is delivered thus, <hi>The right faith is, that we believe and confess,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65890:67"/> that our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God is both God and Man; God of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Father, begotten before the Worlds, and Man of the substance of his Mother, born in the World; perfect God, and perfect Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that this is the <hi>General</hi> Faith of the Christian <hi>Church,</hi> and Antiently was so, is evident from some other Creeds; for, as a learned Man observes,<note place="margin">Joannes Cassianus sit ab Ʋs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serio de Symb.</note>

            <p>To conclude this Head of Discourse, I shall make bold to lay down this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion: That whosoever denieth the Truth of <hi>all</hi> or any <hi>one</hi> of these three forenamed Doctrines; if he <hi>bear</hi> and <hi>own,</hi> he doth also <hi>unjustly claim,</hi> and <hi>usurp</hi> the name of a Christian.<note place="margin">

            <p>IT is evident that this Author will by no means allow our Saviour to be the <hi>true</hi> God; but at length he is so kind to him, as to grant that he is, though a <hi>mere,</hi> yet not a <hi>Common Man;</hi> but a Man advanced above the highest <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi> as appears from his Discourse, which bears this Title, <hi>Of the Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Dignity of Jesus Christ.</hi> But then in his next page he gives us this Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though our Lord be indeed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the highest dignity: <hi>Yet,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is not justifiable to honour Christ falsly.</hi> But is it not far less justifiable to <hi>dishonor</hi> Christ falsly, as every Man doth, who denieth him, that dignity of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65890:70"/>
               <hi>Deity,</hi> which, if we may believe the Scriptures, doth justly belong unto him?</p>
            <p>And here, to prevent an objection, which might be raised against him, this Author names, and gives an answer, such as it is, to that Text, which saith, <hi>That we should honour the Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23.</note>
               <hi>As we honour the Father;</hi> But, saith he, <hi>this, As, doth here import no more Equality of Honour, than that Text imports an equality of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, which saith, Be ye holy, As he, who hath called you, is holy,</hi> So thinks this Author.</p>
            <p>But let him tell me, whether this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>As</hi> doth never import an <hi>Equality</hi> in any other Texts; it is true, when we are commanded to be <hi>holy,</hi> merciful, and Perfect, <hi>as</hi> God is; the thing then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired is a <hi>Resemblance</hi> and imitation, <hi>pro modulo nostro,</hi> of these Excellencies, which are in God, but not an <hi>Equality,</hi> for of that we are utterly uncapable. But when St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17.</note>
               <hi>Be ye followers of me, As I am of Christ,</hi> and again, <hi>Walk, As ye have us for an Example;</hi> did St. <hi>Paul</hi> mean, that we should only in <hi>some degree</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his Pattern, and not <hi>fully</hi> come up to and match his Example in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of our Lives and Conversations?</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:65890:70"/>
            <p>Though St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reach the Example of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet 'tis possible for us quite to reach the Example of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and since 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, 'tis that, I think, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from us. And so we may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude from that Speech of his to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi>

            <p>Now, 'tis very reasonable to believe that St <hi>Paul</hi> meant as much by his <hi>As</hi> in the other Texts, as by his <hi>Altogether</hi> in this; which imports that he would have us not only to <hi>imiate</hi> his Graces, but even to <hi>equal</hi> them too. And if this little Particle, <hi>As,</hi> doth imply an <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in <hi>other</hi> Texts, why not in <hi>this,</hi> which saith, <hi>That we should honour the Son, as we honour the Father;</hi> for, are we not able to <hi>pay</hi> the same honour to the one, which we do pay to the other? Or is the <hi>Son</hi> of God an <hi>unfit</hi> object to <hi>receive</hi> the same honour with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? he himself hath told us, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> and his <hi>Father</hi> himself calls him, <hi>The Man which is my Fellow.</hi> And if our

               <hi>Theophylact</hi> justly blames the <hi>Arians,</hi> for honouring the Son, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. His own Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Deity of Christ being weak and easily baffled, he attempts an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to other Men's Arguments for it. And here, with a great deal of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he thus tells the World, <hi>I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as briefly as I can, to give them such reasonable answers, as shall make these truths</hi> (so he calls his Heretical Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>beyond exception.</hi> Bravely resolved! but we may say, what was said of <hi>Phaeton, magnis tamen excidit ausis;</hi> for, how short he comes of his noble design, we shall easily discover in each particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first Argument for our Lord's Divinity, to which this Respondent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts an answer, is this, That Person,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65890:72"/> to whom the Scriptures in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do ascribe the <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of God, is God. But our Lord is that Person, to whom the Scriptures do in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places ascribe the Character and Title of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Our Lord is God; for, were he not God indeed, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would not so often call him so.</p>
            <p>That the Scriptures do indeed once and again call him <hi>God,</hi> this Man doth not deny; nay, he confesseth, <hi>That a God undoubtedly he is, and a mighty God too:</hi> But how, and in what sense is he so? this Man answers that he is such a God, <hi>According to the way of expression used in those antient times, in which those were called Gods, who either represented God's Person, or acted in his Name, and by his Authority;</hi> but then he adds this bold assertion, <hi>Christ is not God Almighty.</hi> It seems that this Man allows Christ to be no more than a <hi>Titular</hi> God, an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal</hi> God, a God in <hi>Name,</hi> but not by <hi>Nature, i. e.</hi> a God by <hi>Office</hi> only. But what a false pretence this is, will be evident from these three Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scriptures do ascribe to Christ not only the <hi>bare Name</hi> of God, but with such <hi>Adjuncts,</hi> as never did, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can belong to any Person, who was,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65890:72"/> is, or shall be, a God by <hi>Office</hi> only.</p>
            <p>The Evangelical <hi>Prophet</hi> stiles our Lord, <hi>the Mighty God;</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20.</note>
               <hi>the Great God;</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> stiles him, <hi>the True God:</hi> Titles of which no God by <hi>Office</hi> only was, or ever can be capable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures tell us, and so doth Experience too, that Gods by <hi>Office</hi> only must <hi>dye</hi> like other Men; and when they dye, their Office, and together with that, their <hi>Godship</hi> ceaseth for ever.</p>
            <p>But now, 'tis not so with our blessed Saviour; for, to him God the Father hath said, <hi>Thy Throne, O God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note>
               <hi>is for ever and ever.</hi> His Authority and <hi>Godship</hi> shall never end.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scriptures tell us, that our Lord <hi>was</hi> and <hi>will</hi> be God, when there neither were, nor shall be, any Gods by Office only.</p>
            <p>A God he was before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; for St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly say, <hi>By him all things were created;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3.</note> which must needs suppose his own <hi>Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, Eternity,</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.</note> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> as expresly stiles him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5.</note>
               <hi>God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever;</hi> which supposeth the <hi>dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his <hi>Godhead,</hi> when Gods by Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice shall be no more. And this, I think, is enough to shew this Author's great mistake, and to convince him that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65890:73"/> those Texts which ascribe to our Lord, the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of God, do not mean that he is a God by <hi>Office</hi> only, but by <hi>Nature;</hi> and if so, he must needs be God Almighty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second Argument for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ, to which this Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give an answer, is this, <hi>If our Lord were not God as well as Man, he could not have been a fit Mediator betwixt God and Man.</hi> But our Lord was a fit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He was God as well as Man.</p>
            <p>That our Lord, according to the <hi>minor</hi> Proposition, was indeed a <hi>fit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> betwixt God and Man, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth not deny; but being loath to grant the Conclusion to the <hi>major</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, he thus replieth, <hi>Christ being a Man perfectly righteous, was therefore fit to intercede between God and Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Answer will not do; for no <hi>mere</hi> Man, how righteous soever, was <hi>fit to undertake,</hi> because not <hi>able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> this great and difficult Work; for, here was an <hi>Infinite Justice</hi> to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, an <hi>Infinite Guilt</hi> to be removed, an <hi>Infinite Happiness</hi> to be procured, which things no <hi>mere</hi> Man could do. For had our Lord been a <hi>Man,</hi> a Creature, and no <hi>more,</hi> being made under the Law, he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65890:73"/> had been obliged to obey all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God for <hi>himself;</hi> and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where all any Man's Acts of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are <hi>due</hi> for himself, none can be <hi>meritorious</hi> for <hi>other</hi> Men. Nor was it possible for any <hi>mere</hi> Man to have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>Justice</hi> of God for the sin of the whole World; the blood of Sheep and Lambs being innocent Creatures might as well have done it as the blood of a mere <hi>righteous</hi> Man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 30.28.</note>
               <hi>God hath purchased his Church with his own blood.</hi> Indeed, God hath no blood; but the Man who had blood, was God too; and with such or none, could his Church be purchased. So then, should we allow that a mere righteous Man might have been a fit Mediatour of <hi>Intercession,</hi> which yet we do not grant; yet a fit Mediatour of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> he could not be. And since our case required both, no mere Man could have been sufficient for us. But more of this under another head.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Argument for the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, to which this Man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts an answer, is this, <hi>That Person who is One with God the Father, is and must be God. But Christ is a Person who is One with God the Father. Ergo,</hi> Christ is and must be God.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65890:74"/>
            <p>The Truth of the <hi>minor</hi> Proposition this Author dares not question, because our Lord himself hath plainly said, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> hath said, <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, and these three are one.</hi> These <hi>two</hi> Texts do so gall our <hi>Socinians,</hi> that they would willingly expunge and blot the <hi>latter</hi> quite out of the <hi>Canon;</hi> but since they can not do that, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to evacuate the force of both by a Distinction.</p>
            <p>To that purpose this Man tells us, that this <hi>Oneness,</hi> which is said to be betwixt our Lord and his Father, is not <hi>Natural</hi> but <hi>Moral;</hi> an Oneness not of <hi>Essence,</hi> but of <hi>Consent,</hi> Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and indeed such an Oneness as this, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>Will,</hi> there is betwixt all the three Persons of the Godhead. But since this kind of <hi>Unity</hi> is common to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> we have reason to think, that it is another <hi>sort</hi> of Unity, an Unity of <hi>Nature,</hi> peculiar to these glorious Persons, which is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in both these Texts.</p>
            <p>And so was it understood by those <hi>Jews,</hi> who heard our Lord say, <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> For why else did they immediately take up stones to kill him? For which they gave him this only
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65890:74"/> reason, <hi>Because thou being a Man makest thy self God.</hi> They took this Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> to be an evidence, and so it is that our Lord owned a <hi>natural</hi> Unity betwixt himself and his Father, and thereby made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when they who heard this Speech and knew the occasion of it, told our Lord, <hi>Thou makest thy self God;</hi> this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor plainly saith, <hi>They belyed him;</hi> But doth not this Man belye <hi>them</hi> in saying so? For can we think, that if the <hi>Jews</hi> had mistook our Saviour's meaning, he would not have explained himself and undeceived them, when by such a misapprehension of his meaning, his Life, before his time was come, was in so much danger? But our Lord was so far from excusing his own expression, or denying the meaning of it to be what the <hi>Jews</hi> supposed; that he rather <hi>owned</hi> and confirmed it by asserting himself to be the <hi>Son</hi> of God, which vertually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the same truth, since he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Son, but the <hi>only begotten</hi> Son, and consequently one in <hi>Nature,</hi> Essence and Substance with his Father.</p>
            <p>And that the same <hi>natural</hi> Unity is intended in that other Text, which saith, <hi>There are Three that bear record in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65890:75"/> Heaven, and these Three are One,</hi> is very probable; for, whereas 'tis said of the three Witnesses, <hi>that bear record on Earth, they agree in One;</hi> 'tis said of the three Witnesses, <hi>that bear record in Heaven, these Three are One.</hi> Here seems to be a plain <hi>Antithesis</hi> betwixt these two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, They <hi>Are</hi> one, and, They <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> in one; and if so, they cannot sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the same thing; but the one must import <hi>primarily</hi> an <hi>Unity</hi> of Nature, and consequently an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Consent;</hi> but the other an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Consent</hi> only.</p>
            <p>That these Texts are thus to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and no otherwise; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Twelfth Section of this Tract, produced the Authorities of many learned Men, with whom this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is not worthy to be named; for if we shall put <hi>them</hi> and <hi>him</hi> into an equal balance, <hi>their</hi> Judgment will as much outweigh <hi>his,</hi> as <hi>Bow-bell</hi> or <hi>Great Tom</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi> or <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> would outweigh the least <hi>Bell</hi> in any of this Man's <hi>Clocks.</hi>

            <p>THE Fourth Argument for our Lord's Divinity, to which this learned Respondent thought fit to give some answer, is this, <hi>That Person, who justly thought it no robbery to be equal with God, is, and needs must be God. But our blessed Saviour is that Person who just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought it no robbery to be equal with God. Ergo,</hi> Our blessed Saviour is, and needs must be God.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly saith of Christ, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of God, he thought it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Now, if it were a robbery, our Lord did very ill to think it none; but dares this Man entertain one such blasphemous thought of Christ; but if indeed it were <hi>no</hi> robbery, then is Christ <hi>equal</hi> to God, which yet he could not be, if he were not God.</p>
            <p>But to this Expression of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, this Man opposeth that Speech of Christ, <hi>My Father is greater than I;</hi> from which Text he thus concludes, <hi>If the Son be any ways equal to the Father, yet 'tis really but in some particulars, and in some things he may be equal, though
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65890:76"/> in all things he cannot.</hi> So he. To which I answer,</p>

'Tis observable, that although St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth positively affirm of Christ, that, <hi>he thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> yet this Man <hi>suspects</hi> at first, and doubts this equality; for thus he writes, <hi>If the Son be any way equal to the Father.</hi> This, <hi>If,</hi> is a note of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust</hi> and diffidence; and plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that although our Lord thought himself to be equal to his Father, yet this Man is <hi>jealous</hi> and doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Lord be so indeed, or not. But since this one Text is enough to confute all the pretences of this rank <hi>Socinian,</hi> we cannot wonder, that he should be so very unwilling to believe it true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Man upon second thoughts, being somewhat convinced by the force of this Text, but yet still very loath to confess the whole truth, doth yield at length, <hi>That Christ may be equal to God in some things,</hi> and this one he names, <hi>In saving believers;</hi> but then he adds, <hi>This Power of Christ in doing this is not essential, but derived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was this man in his right Wits when he wrote this so manifestly to contradict himself, and so quickly to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65890:76"/> overthrow his own Concession? For, first he tells us, <hi>That in some things Christ may be equal with God;</hi> and as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that Equality, he saith, <hi>As God can save believers, so also this Christ can do, but by a derived Power only.</hi> But is a <hi>derived</hi> Power <hi>equal</hi> to that, which is <hi>Essential?</hi> Is the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>Constable</hi> equal to that of his <hi>King,</hi> by whose Commission he acts? Doth such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived Power at all imply our Lord's <hi>Equality</hi> to his Father in saving Souls? If so, Why may not St. <hi>Paul</hi> be said to be <hi>equal</hi> with God; for we cannot doubt, but by a <hi>derived</hi> Power, and as an <hi>Instrument,</hi> he saved many?</p>
            <p>And indeed, whosoever acts by a <hi>derived</hi> Power, acts but as an <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and if that were our Lord's Case, as this Man pretends, then as there is no <hi>Equality</hi> betwixt an <hi>Instrument</hi> and the <hi>Principal Agent,</hi> so neither could there be that <hi>Equality</hi> betwixt our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Father</hi> in saving Believers, or in any thing else, which yet this Man first <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> and then <hi>contradicts</hi> by this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>'Tis plain that he from whom Christ receives his Power, must in Power be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to him.</hi> Now, if there be such a <hi>Superiority,</hi> there can be no <hi>Equality;</hi> for, 'tis an old Rule, <hi>Par in parem non
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65890:77"/> habet potestatem.</hi> And yet this <hi>derived</hi> Power of Christ in saving Souls, which must needs imply something of <hi>Inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> is the only Instance which this Man names of that <hi>Equality,</hi> which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth to be betwixt our Lord and his Father, and thus doth he contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But although this Author doth, though somewhat unwillingly, allow our Lord an <hi>Equality</hi> with his Father in <hi>some</hi> things, yet he makes bold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that allowance, and plainly tells the World, <hi>That Christ cannot be equal to God in All things,</hi> to which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thus;</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> giving us an Intimation, that Christ is <hi>equal</hi> with God, delivers it in <hi>Terms Indefinite;</hi> and if an Indefinite Proposition, <hi>in materia necessaria,</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to an <hi>Universal</hi> in other Cases, 'tis so in this. And how dares this Man <hi>confine</hi> and limit this equality of Christ with God, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes to him without <hi>restriction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the truth is, if Christ be <hi>equal</hi> to God in <hi>some</hi> things; nay, in any <hi>one</hi> thing as this Man grants; he must in the same respect be equal to him in <hi>All</hi> things whatsoever, why our Lord was equal to his Father, St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65890:77"/> left us this account, <hi>Being in the form of God he thought it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Which Text imports that our Lord's <hi>Equality</hi> with his Father doth arise from his being in the <hi>form</hi> of God; <hi>i. e.</hi> from his <hi>Divine Essence</hi> and Godhead. Now although we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our weak Capacity, do frame to our selves some <hi>different Ideas</hi> and divers apprehensions of the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, as if there were some <hi>real</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between them, yet in truth there is none. For, say the Schools, <hi>Quicquid est in Deo, est Deus,</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in God, is God; his Attributes are not really distinguished from his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and since that Essence is <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> where there is any <hi>one</hi> of its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, there must they <hi>All</hi> be.</p>
            <p>And this was and is the Case of the Son of God, who is <hi>equal</hi> to his Father in <hi>all</hi> the Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; so he is, 1. In his <hi>Eternity;</hi> for he saith of himself,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.8.</note>
               <hi>I am Alpha and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega, the first and the last.</hi> 2. In his <hi>Omnipotence;</hi> for St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>By him all things were created.</hi> 3. In his <hi>Omnipresence;</hi> for we learn from his own Mouth, that he was both in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and in <hi>Earth</hi> at once. 4. In his <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3.</note>
               <hi>In him are hid
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65890:78"/> all the Treasures of Wisdom,</hi> and if All, there can be nothing more.</p>
            <p>Now if our Lord before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being then as still he is, in the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> was in <hi>all</hi> these perfections, which are but the same thing with the Divine <hi>Essence, equal</hi> to his Father; that Essence being <hi>Indivisible,</hi> and uncapable of any thing <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> he must be equal to him in <hi>all</hi> the rest. And how then dare this bold <hi>Mechanick</hi> say, <hi>Christ cannot be equal to his Father in all things, though in some things he may?</hi> One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance he gives us wherein he <hi>may</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; but he prudently names no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, wherein he <hi>cannot</hi> be so.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident from these Texts, that the Son of God was <hi>every</hi> way equal to his Father before his Incarnation, and whilst he continued his <hi>Being only in the form of God.</hi> And although he lost nothing of that form, and that equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon account thereof; yet when once by his Infinite Condescension, he had assumed into his own most Sacred Person another <hi>inferiour</hi> Nature, and <hi>took upon him the form of a Servant;</hi> then, and not till then, might he justly say, <hi>My Father is greater than I,</hi> which must needs be understood in relation to his <hi>humanity;</hi> for his perfect equality
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65890:78"/> to his Father, in his higher capacity, being unchangeable, then did, now doth, and for ever will remain; and such an equality must needs prove him God.</p>

            <p>THE fifth Argument for our Lords Divinity, which this man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to overthrow, but never can, is this, <hi>That Person, who created the world, is and must be God. But our Lord is that Person, who created the world, Ergo,</hi> our Lord is and needs must be God.</p>
            <p>The Major Proposition is so clearly grounded upon so many Texts, and carrieth in it so much evidence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason, that this Author did not think fit to offer one word against its Truth. But although the Minor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be as expresly delivered in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Texts; yet, for fear of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, he saw himself concerned to elude those Texts, and pretend some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in answer to them; and all, that he could invent, is only this, <hi>All Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which affirm Christ to be the maker of all things, must be supposed to speak
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65890:79"/> Figuratively;</hi> but why so? He gives this doubty Reason for it. <hi>'Tis self evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in a literal sense he could never be the maker of the world, whose Being did begin to be some thousands of years after the world was made;</hi> so disputes this mighty <hi>Sophister,</hi> but still upon false suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For, he supposeth 1. That those Texts, which affirm Christ to be the maker of the World, are <hi>Figurative.</hi> 2. That our Lord had no <hi>real existence</hi> before his Incarnation; both which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are utterly false.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To suppose all those Texts, which represent our Lord as the great <hi>Creatour</hi> of the Universe, to be <hi>Figurative,</hi> is a silly dream, and a vain pretence, invented without any ground, only to elude the force of those Scriptures, because in their <hi>literal</hi> sense they do so evidently overthrow the <hi>Socinian Hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> tells us, <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> words <hi>literally</hi> understood by all Men.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.</note> St. <hi>John,</hi> writing of the same matter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing thereby to prove our Lords <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Stile, begins his <hi>Gospel,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> began his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, by him all things were made.</hi> The
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65890:79"/> Creation of the World, which <hi>Moses</hi> more <hi>generally</hi> ascribes to God: St. <hi>John</hi> more <hi>particularly</hi> ascribes to the <hi>Second Person,</hi> whom he calls the <hi>Word,</hi> the proofs of whose <hi>Godhead,</hi> being even then denied by <hi>Ebion,</hi> was the great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion and intent of his whole Gospel.</p>
            <p>Now, let any Man give us a solid Reason, why there should be a <hi>Figure</hi> in these words of St. <hi>John,</hi> whereas there is none pretended in those words of <hi>Moses;</hi> I think, the only Reason, that can be given, is this; those words of <hi>Moses</hi> in their <hi>literal</hi> sense do not cross the Opinion of our <hi>Socinians,</hi> but these words of St. <hi>John literally</hi> understood, as indeed they ought to be, do utterly <hi>Confound</hi> it.</p>
            <p>But since this Man hath found, as he seems to pretend, what none of the Antient Learned Interpreters had the good luck to find out before him, I mean, a <hi>Figure</hi> in every Text, wherein Christ is said to be the <hi>maker of the World,</hi> he should have told us, what <hi>Trope</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> it is, and by what name it is called. We may presume that he means a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> because he compares these Texts with those, wherein our Lord Stiles himself, <hi>a Way, a Door, a Vine,</hi> which, saith he, are <hi>Figurative</hi> or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65890:80"/>
               <hi>Mystical Expressions, in which one thing is said to signifie another, as the Old Creation to set forth the New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, this Authors meaning must be this, that every Text, wherein Christ is said to be <hi>the Maker of all things,</hi> must be referred, not to the <hi>Old Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> described by <hi>Moses;</hi> but to the <hi>New Creation, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the World, and the great Change of Religion, the abolishing of the Old Covenant, the establishing of a new one with all its Consequences, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Christ, and the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of his Gospel.</p>
            <p>This being our Authors undoubted meaning, this consequence must ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably follow; namely, that if we can find any Texts, wherein Christ is said to be the <hi>Maker of such things,</hi> and <hi>such persons,</hi> as were no way concerned in the <hi>New</hi> Creation; then must such Texts be understood of the <hi>Old</hi> one; and that our Lord, being the <hi>Author</hi> of it, must needs be the Omnipotent and eternal God.</p>
            <p>And such is that Text, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> borrows from the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> and most evidently applieth to our blessed Saviour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10.</note>
               <hi>Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65890:80"/> the Heavens are the work of thy hands.</hi> Certainly this, <hi>laying the foundation of the Earth and the Heavens,</hi> at least, <hi>This Earth and these Heavens,</hi> themselves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought Terms <hi>Metaphorical;</hi> and what were they concerned in the <hi>new</hi> Creation?</p>
            <p>But there is yet another Text, more full than this, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks thus of Christ;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.</note>
               <hi>By him were all things created, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, Visible and Invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominations, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, or Powers, All things were Created by him:</hi> but how can that be, saith our <hi>Socinian?</hi> How can he be the Creatour, who first <hi>began</hi> to be so many years <hi>after</hi> the Creation? But will not this Man believe St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17.</note> who answers this objection, and saith of Christ, <hi>He is before all things, i. e.</hi> in point of <hi>Time</hi> and Pre-existence, as well as in point of <hi>Dignity</hi> and Pre-eminence.</p>
            <p>Now, hath our <hi>Socinian</hi> Author the Face to pretend that this Text is <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical,</hi> and must be interpreted of the <hi>New</hi> Creation? If so, let him tell us, how those invisible <hi>Spirits,</hi> which are in Heaven above, and are here reckoned as our <hi>Lord's Creatures,</hi> did stand in <hi>need</hi> of, and were <hi>interested</hi> in, and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:65890:81"/> by, this <hi>New</hi> Creation; but if these words, according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral persuasion of the most judicious Expositours, are to be understood in a <hi>literal</hi> sense; then are they an invincible Argument that our Lord was indeed the Author of the <hi>first</hi> Creation, and his being so is an infallible evidence of his <hi>Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here this Author seems to give us an intimation, that he reckons these and the like Texts, which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>New</hi> Creation, but prove our Lord to be the Author of the <hi>Old</hi> one, among those difficult passages, of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> faith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</note>
               <hi>They are hard to be understood.</hi> To which, I answer, 'tis indeed very hard to understand these Texts, and I think impossible to make any tolerable sense of them, in a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical,</hi> Improper and <hi>Socinian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; but if they be interpreted, as indeed they ought to be, in a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> sense, and according to the usual signification of their Terms, there are but few Texts more <hi>easie,</hi> obvious, and Intelligible. But our <hi>Socinians</hi> are highly concerned to strain and force these Texts to an <hi>unnatural</hi> sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, being rightly understood, they utterly <hi>destroy</hi> their <hi>Heretical</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65890:81"/> and undeniably prove, that Christ is God most high.</p>

            <p>THE next thing, which this <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Trifler attempts, is this; namely, to disprove the Union of the Divine and Humane Natures in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ; and, to that end, he argueth to this effect: <hi>That Person, who died as a Man, could not also be God. But our Lord died as a Man, Ergo,</hi> He could not also be God.</p>
            <p>This Minor Proposition being granted true, to confirm the Major, and so to secure the Conclusion, he gives this Reason; <hi>A person, constituted of two such Natures, could never have died according to his Humane Nature,</hi> but why not? His Reason is this; <hi>One capacity must needs have supplied the defects of the other, especially the stronger of the weaker;</hi> he means, that if Christ had been God, as well as Man, his <hi>Divinity</hi> must have supplied the defects of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> and not to have permitted that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main either <hi>Ignorant</hi> or <hi>Mortal:</hi> To which I answer, as to each Particular:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:65890:82"/>1. There was no necessity that our Lord's <hi>Divinity</hi> should so far supply the defects of <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, as to render that <hi>Omniscient,</hi> had it been capable of being so.</p>
            <p>The truth is, since <hi>Omniscience</hi> is one of those Infinite Perfections, which are no where to be found, but in <hi>God</hi> alone; the want of it must not be thought or blamed as an <hi>Imperfection</hi> in the Nature of <hi>Man.</hi> what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, is true of the best of Men;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.</note>

            <p>And this was our blessed Saviour's own case; for, as he was <hi>Man,</hi> he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased</hi> in Wisdom by degrees, as other Men do; yet at a far higher rate, and far greater measures, yet not so as to become Omniscient; for the Particular
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65890:82"/> day and hour of the last Judgment was concealed from his Humane Soul, nor was there any need that it should be revealed to him, as Man; because it was no part of that Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to instruct the World.</p>
            <p>It was enough that Christ, as <hi>Man,</hi> was furnish'd with so much knowledg, as enabled him to reveal the whole will of God, to interpret the Moral Law, to instruct his Church, to solve all doubts, to confute all Errors, and to understand the very Hearts and Thoughts of Men. And since he had such a knowledg, as was sufficient for the discharge of that great Work, and those high Offices, which he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature could need no more. And if so, it was no more necessary that our Lords <hi>Divinity</hi> should render his Humane Nature <hi>Omniscient,</hi> than that it should render it <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> which had been <hi>needless</hi> and is <hi>Impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There was no necessity that our Lord's <hi>Divinity</hi> should, as this Man contends, have so far supplied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Immortal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, this was so far from being <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> that it had been utterly <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with that great End, for which

            <p n="3">3. Whereas this Author makes this demand; <hi>How could he in Person be

            <p>'Tis no new thing for a Person, constituted of two <hi>different</hi> Natures, to be <hi>mortal</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Capacity, and yet <hi>immortal</hi> in <hi>another.</hi> The Man, who makes this demand, is so himself; the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>every</hi> Man is <hi>mortal,</hi> but the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>no</hi> Man is so.

            <p>When our Lord died, the <hi>natural</hi> Union of his Humane <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> was broken; but the <hi>Personal</hi> Union of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Natures was not dissolved; his <hi>Spirit</hi> indeed was separated from his <hi>Flesh,</hi> but neither his <hi>Flesh</hi> nor <hi>Spirit</hi> was parted from his <hi>Divinity.</hi> When first he became a <hi>perfect</hi> Man, the same moment he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>God-man</hi> too; and his two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being united, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>For, all that he saith, is impertinent and amounts to no more than this, <hi>That our Lord, as born of a Virgin, was not the Son of God's Person, but of his Power only; not his natural Son, not begotten of his Father's Substance:</hi> and pray, Sir, who denieth any thing of all this? Doth any <hi>Trinitarian</hi> affirm that our Lord, in respect of his <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> was so begotten? If not, why doth this Man tacitly charge us with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65890:85"/> an Opinion, which none of us do own? The Faith of the Catholick <hi>Church</hi> about this matter, is delivered in the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creeds. wherein 'tis said of our Lord, <hi>That he is God of the Substance of his Father;</hi> but how and when came he to be so?

            <p>And that our Lord was in <hi>Actual</hi> being before his <hi>birth</hi> from the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is a Truth as sure, as the plain word of God can make it.<note place="margin">

            <p>THE Authority of our Saviour's <hi>Miracles</hi> is the next thing, which this Author cites and boldly calls in question, telling us, that they do not prove him, God, because he did them, as <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> did, not by a Power <hi>inherent</hi> in himself, but <hi>derived</hi> from God; and to prove that, he names several Texts, wherein 'tis said, that his Power was given him. To which we answer thus,</p>
            <p>When our Lord was pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Man,</hi> it was requisite that his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature should be invested
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65890:88"/> with so much power, as might enable him to work more and greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, than ever <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> did. His business was to put an End to the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, which the <hi>Jews</hi> were very fond of; his business was to plant a <hi>New</hi> Religion, which both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> much opposed. Now, to justify his Commission from Heaven for the doing of this, and to prove himself the promised <hi>Messias,</hi> his working of such Miracles was very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. But forasmuch as such mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works do far transcend the very utmost abilities of Man, a <hi>supernatural</hi> Power was lent to our Lord's <hi>humane</hi> Nature from above by his <hi>Father,</hi> and by <hi>himself</hi> too. For, as in our <hi>natural</hi> Actions the Hand of Man, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodily Members, do act by that vigour, which they derive from the Soul, to which they are united; even so in our Lord's <hi>supernatural</hi> Actions did his Humanity act by that Power, which his <hi>Manhood</hi> derived from his own <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> the fulness whereof, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>dwelt in him bodily.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>'Tis evident that our Lord had Power enough to work Miracles long <hi>before</hi> his Incarnation; for the greatest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65890:89"/> that was ever wrought, was the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World; 'tis an Act of Omnipotence to <hi>raise</hi> the dead, and yet that is but to <hi>restore</hi> something out of something; but an Act of <hi>Creation; productio entis ex non ente,</hi> the producing of <hi>something</hi> out of <hi>nothing,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>reconciling Contradictions,</hi> is a greater Act of Power than any mere Act of <hi>Restitution.</hi> Now this Work of Creation, of all Wonders the greatest, do the Scriptures frequently and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ascribe to our blessed Saviour; we are there told again and again, <hi>By him were all things made;</hi> and if by him, then by his <hi>own</hi> Power too; for, 'tis the constant Doctrine of the <hi>Schools,</hi> that a <hi>creating</hi> Power is so <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Godhead,</hi> that it can never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to any <hi>Creature;</hi> so that if our Lord created the World, as most certainly he did, he must needs do it, as being God, and by a proper and <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi> Power of his; for to be invested with such a <hi>borrowed</hi> Power is beyond the capacity of all <hi>created</hi> Beings. And if our Lord by his <hi>own</hi> Power did <hi>create</hi> this glorious Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, we may justly believe, that by the same Power he did those easier

'Tis evident from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression that St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> owned an <hi>Omnipotent Power</hi> inherent in our Lord long <hi>before</hi> his Incarnation.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:65890:90"/>
            <p>True it is, our Lord's <hi>humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had an extraordinary Power given unto it, partly as a necessary <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to fit him for his great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to confirm his Commission, to recommend his Person and his Doctrine to the World; and after his Passion, as a just <hi>Reward</hi> of his Service and Sufferings. So speaks St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.</note>
               <hi>He took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</hi> Here's an Intimation of our Lord's <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> in his humane Nature, but what's his Reward? The next words tell us, <hi>Wherefore God also hath high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name;</hi>

            <p>All this Power our Lord received as <hi>Man;</hi> but if he had not a like Power before his Incarnation, then saith Great St. <hi>Basil,</hi>

               </gap>, which Conceit, saith he, would be very absurd indeed.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this, I think we should not gratify our <hi>Socinians</hi> in the least, nor at all prejudice the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Lord's Divinity, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he did indeed <hi>originally</hi> receive all his Power from God the <hi>Father;</hi> for, in the same Moment, or rather the same Eternity, wherein God the Father did communicate to God the Son his own <hi>entire Nature</hi> and Essence, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being <hi>Indivisible,</hi> he must of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity communicate to him <hi>all</hi> those Infinite <hi>Perfections,</hi> which are <hi>Essential</hi> to it, and inseparable from it, whereof <hi>Omnipotence</hi> is One.</p>
            <p>So then, to say that our Lord wrought his Miracles in his <hi>humane</hi> Nature by the exercise of that Power, which he <hi>originally</hi> received from his <hi>Father,</hi> is no greater, a Prejudice to his <hi>Divinity,</hi> than to say, that by an Act of eternal <hi>Generation</hi> he received his <hi>Godhead</hi> from him, for they were communicated to him both at once.</p>

            <p>THIS worthy <hi>Gentleman</hi> proceeds like a Confident <hi>Heretick,</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer an Argument as used by us, to prove the Possibility of three distinct Persons in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and thus he is pleased to word it for us, <hi>God is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, and may, for ought we know, be that which yet we cannot painly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him to be; namely, that he is Three in Person, though but One in Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by this Man's favour, we do very plainly understand him so to be, as to the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Thing;</hi> though as to the <hi>manner How</hi> we confess our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, nor do we presume curiously to enquire into it, much less saucily to determine of it. 'Tis ground enough for our Faith, that the Scriptures have evidently revealed it.</p>
            <p>Now to this Argument of his own framing, this Disputant answers thus, <hi>Though we cannot know what God is in every respect, yet at the same time we may certainly know what he is not;</hi> as 1. <hi>That he is not a Man.</hi> 2. <hi>That he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65890:92"/> is not mortal.</hi> 3. <hi>That he hath not a God above him.</hi> 4. <hi>That he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any kind of Power from another.</hi> All which this Man imputes to our blessed Saviour as so many Evidences, that he is not God. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To his first Allegation, <hi>That God is not a Man,</hi> we thus reply; That in the <hi>Abstract,</hi> the <hi>Deity</hi> is not the <hi>Humanity;</hi> that the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is not the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> we do easily grant, but notwithstanding this, <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creto,</hi> we believe that there may be, and have already proved, that there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is one Person, our blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who by the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, is both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to his second Allegation, <hi>That God is not Mortal,</hi> we easily grant its Truth, <hi>Dii Immortales,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, were the known Characters of <hi>supposed Deities</hi> amongst the <hi>Heathens.</hi> But withal, our Lord was made a Man, that he might be <hi>mortal;</hi> that for the Pardon of sin he might have <hi>Blood</hi> to shed; for, saith the Apostle, <hi>Without shedding of blood there's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.</note> Nor would the Blood of Bulls
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65890:92"/> or Goats, or any mere Man, have served the turn; and for that reason, the Son of God was pleased to become a Man, that he might be in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to die, and actually die he did; and so as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God purchased his Church with his own Blood,</hi> i. e. with the Blood of that Sacred Person, who was <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man;</hi> Man he was, that he might have Blood; and God he was, that his Blood might be valuable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To this Man's third Allegation, <hi>That God hath not a God above him,</hi> we answer by Concession; for, God is very justly stiled, <hi>optimus, maximus,</hi> as the <hi>best,</hi> so the <hi>supreme</hi> and highest of <hi>Beings.</hi> And such a Being is our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, who, being <hi>in the form of God,</hi> is one with his Father, <hi>co-ordinate,</hi> co-eternal, and co-equal with him in all the glorious Perfections of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. But in regard of his <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, which is a finite Creature, he is <hi>inferiour</hi> to his Father; and in that Capacity alone must we understand that Speech of his, <hi>My Father is greater than I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:65890:93"/>4. This Man's fourth Allegation is this, <hi>That God hath not received any kind of Power from another;</hi> to which we answer thus. The <hi>first</hi> Person in the Trinity received no Power from another, but the <hi>second</hi> did, and yet is <hi>God</hi> notwithstanding; for, God the <hi>Father</hi> communicating his eternal <hi>Power</hi> to his <hi>Son,</hi> did by the self same Act, communicate to him his own eternal <hi>Godhead</hi> too, from which his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is inseparable. And that our Lord did at once, and that from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, receive from his Father his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and his Power with it, is undeniably proved by our Lord's creating the World; a Work, saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</note> which evidently proves <hi>His Eternal Power</hi> and <hi>Godhead,</hi> which are two Divine Things never to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Author's next Allegation is this, <hi>We know certainly, that if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Godhead did consist of three Persons, that then neither of the three Persons singly can be God.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>Methinks this Person writes, as if he, or we, thought the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be <hi>Divisible,</hi> as if the <hi>Father</hi> had the <hi>First</hi> share, the <hi>Son</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:65890:93"/> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> the <hi>Third;</hi> as if there needed a <hi>Club</hi> or Contribution of their several shares to make up the <hi>entire Godhead.</hi> If this be not his <hi>own</hi> thoughts 'tis very far from being <hi>ours,</hi> and why then doth he say, <hi>That none of the three Persons singly can be God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Catholick Faith about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is well known to be this, <hi>That the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God.</hi> Each Person is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God; and yet it doth not follow, as this Man saith, <hi>That they may be said to be three supreme Beings or Godheads,</hi> because the Divine Essence being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and <hi>Indivisible,</hi> subsisting in three Persons, is <hi>numerically One</hi> and the same. But,</p>
            <p n="6">6. This Author still proceeding with the same Confidence, tells us thus, <hi>We know certainly, that if any of the three Persons, said to be in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, be God by himself, as we have proved God the Father undoubtedly is, than all the rest are superfluous and unnecessary as to the constitution of the Godhead.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>Methinks this is such an high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> as no good Man would be guilty of for all the World;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65890:94"/> How dares a poor <hi>worm</hi> proclaim the <hi>eternal Son</hi> of God to be a <hi>superfluous</hi> Person? Is there no need of him, who is our only Saviour? And how dares a Clod of <hi>warm Clay</hi> to tell the World that he certainly knows the <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> of God, who is our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier, Comforter, and Guide, to be an <hi>unnecessary Being?</hi> What meant our Lord to command his Apostles to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> if this <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> be <hi>needless Persons?</hi> What meant. St. <hi>John</hi> to tell us, <hi>There are Three that bear record in Heaven;</hi> if <hi>two</hi> of these <hi>Three</hi> stand but for <hi>Ciphers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be no Assertion more false and Impudent than this, and yet this Man saith, <hi>We certainly know it;</hi> But how doth he know it, and that with so much certainty? In matters of Faith the infallible <hi>Word</hi> of God is the only <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>certainty;</hi> and if that be the ground of this Man's assurance, Why did he forbear to name particular Texts to prove it? But all his Proofs is drawn from his own <hi>fallible Understanding,</hi> and his Reason is this, <hi>One Infinite, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and most Wise Person is as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to all the purposes of a Godhead,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65890:94"/> as ten thousand Deities.</hi> To which we answer thus:</p>
            <p>Were such an Argument urged in relation to Men, it would hold good; for, suppose three Men alike invested with <hi>equal</hi> Power; if any <hi>one</hi> of these three would surely and fully exercise this Power to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and in all cases, which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, the other two, might be spared. For, three Men, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <hi>finite,</hi> and but <hi>specifically</hi> the same, are <hi>separate</hi> and divided persons; and consequently their <hi>power,</hi> residing in <hi>different</hi> Subjects, though it be the self same in <hi>kind</hi> and degree, yet it may be different in its <hi>Execution;</hi> for the <hi>One</hi> may act without the <hi>other;</hi> and if any <hi>one</hi> of them effectually doth so, the other <hi>Two</hi> are superfluous.</p>
            <p>But if we shall suppose a <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> three Men invested with equal Power, yet so that they all should stand obliged jointly to concur in every Act, that no <hi>two</hi> of them could do any thing without the consent of the <hi>Third;</hi> upon this supposition, none of them were superfluous, not <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi> could be spared.</p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:65890:95"/>
            <p>Now, if it be lawful, <hi>Parvis compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere Magna,</hi> I would say, that this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Case doth somewhat <hi>resemble</hi> or <hi>illustrate</hi> that of the <hi>Three</hi> Glorious <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> who are indeed <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> subsistencies, but not <hi>Divided:</hi> their Essence is <hi>one</hi> and numerically the same; and from this unity of their <hi>Nature</hi> there ariseth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, One <hi>Will,</hi> one <hi>Operation:</hi> they <hi>do,</hi> and by a <hi>Necessity</hi> arising from their own <hi>Nature,</hi> they needs <hi>must</hi> conspire in every Act, which relates to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the World, the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Man, the <hi>support</hi> and Government of the whole Universe. For although we do commonly attribute the Work of <hi>Creation</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> of <hi>Sanctification</hi> to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> yet this is not to be understood <hi>exclusively,</hi> as if every one of these Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Persons had not an hand in each of these Gracious Works.</p>
            <p>No; the Rule is this, <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt Indivisa.</hi> Those external Works of God, which respect his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are undivided; what <hi>one</hi> Person doth, <hi>all Three</hi> do; for the <hi>Unity</hi> of their <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>sameness</hi> of their <hi>Will,</hi> the <hi>Identity</hi> of their <hi>Power</hi> and all their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65890:95"/> Essential Perfections, cannot permit, that it should be otherwise. And for this reason alone our Lord told the <hi>Jews</hi> thus:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19.</note>
               <hi>The Son can do nothing of himself;</hi> but why not? Was it for want of Power? No, for he saith in the same Verse, <hi>Whatsoever things the Father doth, these also doth the Son likewise;</hi> and of that he gives us this particular instance. <hi>As the Father raiseth up the dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 21.</note>
               <hi>and quickneth them, even so the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi> But why then did our Lord say, <hi>The Son can do nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</hi> He means, nothings <hi>distinct</hi> from the Work of his Father; accordingly he tells us, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 17.</note>
               <hi>and I work,</hi> by which Expression the <hi>Jews</hi> did rightly understand that he <hi>made himself equal with God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 18.</note> though neither they did, nor this Man doth, believe him to be so.</p>
            <p>But that is the true Faith of the Christian Church; and since the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are most certainly <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> God, they must have one Will, one Power, and one way of working; for in this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity, as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">Fulgenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ae fide Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxa.</note>
               <hi>Sic totum unum est, ut nihil ibi possit sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari vel dividi:</hi> All is so <hi>One,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65890:96"/> there can be separated or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. And for this Reason did our Lord say, <hi>Whatsoever things the Father doth, these also doth the Son, and that,</hi>

            <p>Nor indeed can it possibly be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; for our Lord hath said, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in me,</hi>

            <p>It's true, were there but <hi>one</hi> Person truly God, an Infinite, Almighty, and most wise Being, were it really so; we should allow, that <hi>one</hi> Person so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with these and all other Divine perfections would be, as this Man saith, <hi>as sufficient to all the puposes of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65890:96"/> Godhead, as ten thousand Deities.</hi> But since we are clearly taught by those <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> which cannot fail us, and by such plain Texts, as cannot be otherwise understood, that there are <hi>more</hi> Persons than <hi>One,</hi> in whom the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> doth <hi>Equally</hi> subsist; their Essence, Will, Power, and all other their Essential Excellencies being for ever the <hi>same;</hi> we are persuaded that they all do <hi>voluntarily,</hi> and yet <hi>Necessarily</hi> too, Conspire in all Acts of Power, Wisdom, and Goodness; so that none of them can be Superfluous; and since the Deity is <hi>Indivisible,</hi> we can no more spare any <hi>One,</hi> than <hi>All.</hi> The Father cannot be without the Son; the Son cannot be without the Father, nor the Holy Ghost without both, nor the Church without all Three. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Paragraph, every Person, who is truely God, is <hi>Ens necessarium,</hi> a necessary Being; and consequently the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> being truely God cannot be superfluous, and why then doth this Man pretend that he <hi>certainly</hi> knoweth them both to be so?</p>

            <p>THIS Author, proceeding without any Method, comes now to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer another Argument used to prove our Saviour's Godhead, and this it is, as he tells us in Effect, though not in Form; <hi>That Person, who came down from Heaven, who came forth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and who ascended up where he was before, is and must be God, for an Angel he was not. But our Lord did all this, and was no Angel. Ergo,</hi> He is and must be God.</p>
            <p>To this our Respondent answers thus, <hi>This Argument proves not that, for which it is intended,</hi> but why not? His Reason is this, <hi>'Tis plainly inferred from other Scriptures, that Christ, some time before he was sent to declare the Glad Tidings of the Gospel, was assumed or taken up from the Earth into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more Immediate Presence, there to be instructed in the Mind and Will of God, and to be invested with that great Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power of being a Prince and a Saviour,</hi> So he.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The Reasons, which this Man produceth to prove this pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of Christ into Heaven, are Two; and they are both very weak, frivolous, and inconsiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His first Reason is this, <hi>Our Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>was thus assumed into Heaven, there to be instructed in the Mind and Will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:65890:99"/>
            <p>But what need could there be of such an extraordinary course as this? Was not God able to reveal his whole pleasure to his Son some other way here <hi>below?</hi> Was ever any <hi>Prophet,</hi> or any <hi>Apostle,</hi> except St. <hi>Paul,</hi> took up to Heaven to receive Informations there? That God, who could and did, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1.</note>

Instead of taking him up to <hi>Heaven</hi> it was the good pleasure of God to send down his <hi>Holy Spirit from Heaven,</hi> and to give his <hi>Son</hi> that Spirit without stint or measure; and this was done immediately after his <hi>Baptism,</hi> that he might thereby be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to overcome the Devil, and be most rarely qualified to reveal his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whole Will and Pleasure to the World. And since our blessed Lord was sufficiently instructed in the mind of God by the <hi>descent</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon him, and that so early too; his own <hi>Ascent</hi> into Heaven, to learn his Lesson there, was altogether needless; and if so, then, upon this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65890:99"/> ground, we have no reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second Reason, which this Man offers to prove this pretended Assumption of Christ into Heaven, is this; <hi>our Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>was thus took up into Heaven; there to be invested with that great Dignity of being a Prince and a Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certain that Christ was <hi>born</hi> a <hi>Lord,</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Saviour;</hi> and if so, what need was there of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Providence to take him up into Heaven, that there he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with those glorious Titles, which had already been ascribed unto him by <hi>three wise</hi> Men, and a <hi>wiser Angel,</hi> even when he was but newly dropt from the Womb? After the Attendance of Angels at his Nativity, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est manifestation of his Glory was at his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> and that was upon a <hi>Mount,</hi> but not so high as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And as for his solemn <hi>Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and full possession of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that was reserved for him till after his <hi>Passion, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:65890:100"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26.</note>So run the Scriptures, <hi>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his Glory?</hi> His highest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement was to succeed his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8.</note> so intimates St. <hi>Paul, He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross, wherefore God hath highly exalted him:</hi> But when did God thus exalt him?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 5.30.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, and hanged on a Tree; him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour:</hi> To this great Honour he was not solemnly advanced till after his Resurrection. For although he had the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Saviour</hi> even from his Birth; yet till he had subdued all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, Sin, Death, and Hell, he had no splendid <hi>Coronation.</hi> And if so, to what purpose should our Lord afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand be took up into Heaven? Was it to have the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>Prince</hi> and Saviour given him? No, that was sent down to him by a glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel here below; was it then that he might be fully invested with his <hi>Royal Dignity,</hi> and crowned as a King? No, that work was reserved for his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:65890:100"/> and that <hi>Ascension</hi> of his, which followed it.</p>
            <p>So then, Since both the Reasons which this Man produceth in favour of this pretended Assumption of Christ into Heaven, either to be there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Mind and Will of God, or to be there invested with that Great Dignity of being a Prince and a Saviour, are so improbable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and insignificant, we have no ground to believe it. And the rather because,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Texts, which this Man cites to countenance this pretended Assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ into Heaven before his entrance upon his Publick Ministry, are either <hi>grosly misunderstood,</hi> or <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perverted,</hi> strained, and racked by him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first Text, which this Man cites in favour of this pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, is that of the Prophet Daniel, <hi>I saw in the night visions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13.</note>
               <hi>and behold, one like the Son of man came to the Antient of days, and they brought him before him, and there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, and nations, and languages,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65890:101"/> should serve him.</hi> So this Authour transcribes it, and tells us that to this pretended <hi>Assumption</hi> of Christ into Heaven before his publick preaching, this <hi>vision</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> doth plainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude. To which I answer thus,</p>
            <p>That there are many difficulties in this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion of very judicious Men. <hi>Caeteris Prophetis antecellit obscuritate &amp; praestantia;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cornel. à Lap. in praefat. ad Dan. Pererius in Praefat.</note> So one, and to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thus another, <hi>Videntur in hoc vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumine duae res plus quàm in aliorum Prophetarum libris eminere, doctrinae ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritas &amp; praestantia.</hi> The Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> is more eminent than other Prophecies for <hi>two</hi> things, the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> of it's <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and it's <hi>Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> So dark and enigmatical is this Book, that to understand several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in it, we are told by a very learned Interpreter,<note place="margin">Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Praefat. ad Dan.</note>
               <hi>Multiplex Historia est necessaria,</hi> there is a necessity of great knowledg in the <hi>Histories</hi> of former Ages.</p>
            <p>But although this Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> hath seemed so very <hi>abstruse</hi> and difficult to many Learned Men, yet to this <hi>Seraphical Divine</hi> the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65890:101"/>
               <hi>Clock-maker</hi> it seems but <hi>obvious,</hi> easie, and very Intelligible; for if not, why doth he tell us with so much assurance, that to this Assumption of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven this Vision of <hi>Daniel</hi> doth <hi>plainly</hi> allude? Methinks he determines this doubtful matter as <hi>Magisterially,</hi> as if he sate in the <hi>Roman Chair,</hi> and were become the <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies; nay, he writes as <hi>Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> as if he understood <hi>Daniels</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion far better, not only than all our <hi>Criticks</hi> and Commentators; but even than the <hi>Prophet</hi> himself, who saw and wrote it. For some Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this Prophet had, which yet he did not comprehend; so doth he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ingenuously confess, <hi>I heard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.8, 9.</note>
               <hi>but I understood not,</hi> and when his own Curiosity tempted him to inquire after the meaning of them, the answer, which he received, was this, <hi>Go thy way,</hi> Daniel, <hi>for the words are closed up and sealed.</hi> It's true, 'tis afterwards said, <hi>the wise shall understand,</hi> and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably this Author may be guilty of so much <hi>modesty,</hi> as to reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the number of those <hi>Wise</hi> ones.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:65890:102"/>
            <p>But, In the mean time, this Man cannot acquit himself from the crime of <hi>dissimulation</hi> in dealing with this Text, as the <hi>Devil</hi> dealt with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he <hi>leaves out that,</hi> which he might easily foresee would make <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> him and his Interpretation. For the Text in truth runs thus, <hi>Behold, one, like the Son of Man, came with the clouds of Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> These words, <hi>came with the clouds of Heaven,</hi> this Man doth wholly <hi>leave out,</hi> and there was a great deal of <hi>Policy</hi> in it; for these words are a <hi>Key</hi> to open the meaning of this Vision, and to let us see the better to what it may refer.</p>
            <p>I have not met with any Interpreters, except <hi>Grotius</hi> only, but they do all with one consent refer this Vision to our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> who is here Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically said to be, <hi>One like the Son of Man,</hi> a Title, whereby he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was pleased very often to stile himself. And because this <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> is here said, <hi>To come with the clouds of Heaven,</hi> several Interpreters have thought that this Vision refers to our Lord's <hi>coming to Judgment,</hi> of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65890:102"/> which St. <hi>John</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.7.</note>
               <hi>Behold he cometh with Clouds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Opinion was <hi>Vatablus,</hi> the Text saith, <hi>One like the Son of Man came.</hi> But whether did he come? <hi>Ad Judicium,</hi> he came to <hi>Judgment;</hi> so he And thus <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Clarius, Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur his adventus Christi ad Judicium;</hi> The thing intended in this Vision is the coming of Christ to Judgment; so they. Of the same mind was <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who mentioning this Vision, writes thus, <hi>Christus ipsi Danieli revelatus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tert. adv. Marcion.</hi> l. 40. c. 10.</note>
               <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recto filius hominis, veniens cum coeli nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibus Judex;</hi> Christ was revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> directly as the Son of Man, coming with the Clouds of Heaven as the Judge of the World.</p>
            <p>Now, were it not an Act of too great presumption in me to interpose my slender Judgment, and to declare my own dissent from the Authorities of such great and Learned Men, I would say that there are two things in the Text, which seem to <hi>obviate</hi> their Interpretation of this Vision, and its reference to the Day of <hi>Judgment.</hi> For. 1. Our Lord is here said, <hi>To come to the Antient of Days, and to be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65890:103"/> brought before him;</hi> whereas at the Day of <hi>Judgment</hi> he will be sent down <hi>from</hi> the Antient of Days, for he is already <hi>with</hi> him. Again, 'tis here said, <hi>There was given him Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom,</hi> but that's <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> done, and long <hi>before</hi> the Day of <hi>Judgment.</hi> Once more, 'tis here said, <hi>That all People, and Nations, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages should serve him.</hi> But that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice here on <hi>Earth,</hi> which, I think, this Text intends at the Day of Judgment will be <hi>over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that this Vision should rather point at our Lord's <hi>Ascension</hi> after his Resurrection seems to me far more probable; for the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of this <hi>Vision,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> doth here relate them, are very agreeable to the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of our Lord's <hi>Ascension,</hi> as our <hi>Evangelists</hi> have described them; the <hi>Prophet</hi> saith, <hi>One, like the Son of Man, came to the Antient of Days,</hi> i. e. to God the <hi>Father;</hi> and in the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,</hi> when our Lord was near to his <hi>Ascention,</hi> he said, <hi>I leave the world and go to the Father.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now, there being such an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in so many Circumstances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Prophets Vision</hi> and the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of our <hi>Evangelists;</hi> that this Vision should relate to our Lord's <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension</hi> after his Resurrection, there is great Reason; but why it should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to a <hi>pretended Ascension</hi> some years before his Passion, this Man gives no good reason at all, and yet confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65890:104"/> asserts, <hi>that it plainly doth so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second Text which this Man doth miserably abuse, and would fain force to countenance this <hi>pretended assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Christ into Heaven, is that of the Evangelist,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13.</note> where our Lord saith, <hi>No man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven;</hi> from which words this Man would infer, that our Lord some time or other in his <hi>humane</hi> Nature had been <hi>already</hi> took up into Heaven, and then was sent down again; <hi>and this,</hi> saith he, <hi>is plain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this Man's Sense of this Text be indeed so <hi>plain,</hi> as he pretends, 'tis somewhat of wonder that none of the <hi>antient Fathers,</hi> nor none of our <hi>later Criticks</hi> whom I have consulted, should so understand it, which to me is a great prejudice against its Truth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Criticks</hi> upon the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, 'tis observed that <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> though no <hi>Socinians,</hi> do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret some other Scriptures too much in favour of that ill Opinion; but as for the Text now under debate, neither <hi>Erasmus</hi> nor <hi>Grotius</hi> do interpret or apply it, as this Man doth, nor any way like it.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:65890:104"/>
            <p>And yet our <hi>Clock-maker</hi> tells us, that <hi>from the words of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self 'tis plain that he ascended up into Heaven before he came down to declare his Father's will to men;</hi> for our Lord said, <hi>No man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven;</hi> from which words this Man argueth thus, <hi>No man but Christ ever came down from thence, which he never could have done, had he not first ascended up thither.</hi> Here we have a complication of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods. <hi>No man,</hi> saith he, <hi>but Christ, ever came down from Heaven:</hi> But what thinks he of St. <hi>Paul?</hi> What thinks he of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> at our Lord's <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration?</hi> Again, this Author suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that Christ as <hi>Man</hi> came down from Heaven, which yet he never did, nor ever will do in his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till he come to judge the World, unless it were <hi>Typically</hi> in the <hi>Manna,</hi> of which he said,<note place="margin">

            <p>THere is yet one Text more, which this Author cites, as if it gave some Countenance, though in Truth it yields none to his groundless Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this it is; Our Lord saith, <hi>The Father that sent me,</hi>

               <hi>he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak;</hi> from which words this Man doth thus infer, <hi>That Christ was taken up into Heaven to be instructed in the Doctrine, which he was to publisch to the world.</hi> And here again he saith, <hi>This is plain.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:65890:107"/>
            <p>But is it not a strange Piece of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that a Man who scarce brings one <hi>probable</hi> Argument, should count every thing which he saith, to be so <hi>plain</hi> and evident, as if it were all <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration?</hi> The thing which this Man asserts, is this, <hi>That Christ was took up into Heaven to be instructed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he was to preach:</hi> But how doth this Disputant prove it?

            <p>We are sure that God gave a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Moses,</hi> what he should both <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>write,</hi> and to that end <hi>Moses</hi> was indeed took up into a <hi>Mount,</hi> but not into <hi>Heaven;</hi> God also gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> what they should <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>write;</hi> and yet we do not find that any <hi>one</hi> of them was ever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into <hi>Heaven</hi> to receive their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions there.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</note> No, St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>Holy Men spake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;</hi> and could not our <hi>Lord,</hi> to whom his Father gave the <hi>Spirit</hi> without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, speak so too?</p>

            <p>It was the Promise of God relating to Gospel-times, and fulfilled upon our Lord's <hi>Apostles</hi> on the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi>

            <p>THE next thing which this Man endeavours, but can never do, is to disprove the <hi>Eternity</hi> of Christ; and truely considering his Principles for this attempt, though but a vain one, we cannot blame him. For the <hi>Socinian</hi> Opinion is chiefly grounded upon this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or Supposition, that our Lord had no <hi>real Being</hi> before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, if he had, he must for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable Reasons, have been from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> and consequently must be <hi>God,</hi> which our <hi>Socinians</hi> deny.</p>
            <p>Now, to disprove the <hi>Eternity</hi> of Christ, which this Man knew to be his grand Concern, he makes use of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument drawn from our Lord's
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65890:109"/> double Relation. 1. That to <hi>God,</hi> as his <hi>Father.</hi> 2. That to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> as his <hi>Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And from our Lord's Relation to God as his Father, this Disputant frames his Argument thus; <hi>'Tis impossible for Christ to be Eternal; for if God be his Father, then there was a time when the Son had not a Being; for to be a Son, and to be equal in duration with his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Father that begat him, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly impossible:</hi> So thinks this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>But when will Men cease to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure an <hi>Infinite</hi> and Incomprehensible <hi>Being</hi> by themselves? When will they cease to charge those Divine <hi>Mysteries,</hi> though clearly revealed as to their <hi>truth,</hi> with Contradictions and <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,</hi> barely because the <hi>manner</hi> of them transcends the utmost reach of their own finite, shallow, and dark Understandings? We know, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>Men</hi> no <hi>Son</hi> can be of equal Age with his own <hi>Father,</hi> because there is a natural <hi>Impotence</hi> which disables a <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>beget,</hi> and a <hi>Woman</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> and bring forth a Son, till they themselves be grown up to some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65890:110"/> of strength, which requires se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years; so that there must needs be a considerable distance of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> Besides, among Men the <hi>begetting</hi> of a Son is an Act that's <hi>free</hi> and voluntary; 'tis at every Man's choice whether he will quite forbear such an Act, or <hi>when</hi> he will <hi>attempt</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Thus stands the ease with <hi>Men,</hi> but it is not so with <hi>God;</hi> for, tell me, Dares any saucy Wretch charge the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty with that natural <hi>Imperfection</hi> and Impotence, that is found in Man? What could hinder that God from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting a Son out of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> who in <hi>time</hi> created the World out of nothing? Nor doth such a begetting of such a Son import any necessity, that there should be so much as one <hi>moment</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt him and his Father; For what good reason can be assigned, why God the <hi>Father</hi> might not beget his <hi>Son,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in eodem puncto,</hi> in the very first moment, if I may so speak, wherein he himself was, even from Eternity?</p>
            <pb n="201" facs="tcp:65890:110"/>
            <p>We cannot conceive that the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Firmament, since it was a <hi>Sun,</hi> ever was one moment without its <hi>light;</hi> nor can we conceive that a <hi>Fountain,</hi> which alway overflows, should ever be without a <hi>Stream;</hi> and why may we not think that <hi>God,</hi> ever since he was God, never was one <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> without his Son, who issueth from him as <hi>naturally</hi> and as <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi> as <hi>light</hi> doth from the <hi>Sun,</hi> as a <hi>stream</hi> doth from a never failing <hi>Spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have met with some, who, to prove the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> used this Argument; namely, that it issued not from an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Act of God's free Pleasure, Choice, and Power, but from a <hi>necessity</hi> of his Nature; what these Men thought concerning the <hi>World</hi> in General, we have reason to believe is true concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> that he was, and is, and ever will be the <hi>Son</hi> of God by a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>necessary Generation,</hi> i. e. by an entire Communication of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature to him, which is an Act not <hi>Transient,</hi> but <hi>Eternal.</hi> And for this Reason the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are,

               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Co-eval</hi> and <hi>Co-eternal.</hi> A thing, which this Man thinks impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, barely because it cannot be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Argument, which this Man urgeth against the <hi>Eternity</hi> of Christ, he draws from our Lord's <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the Virgin his <hi>Mother</hi> and her Progenitors.</p>
            <p>And here he minds us, that our Lord was of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> one of <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity, and made of a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> and therefore could not be more <hi>Antient</hi> in time, than <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the <hi>Mother</hi> that bare him. All which proves no more than this; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our Lords <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, which he derived remotely from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> and immediately from his Virgin <hi>Mother,</hi> was not <hi>Eternal;</hi> which we easily grant.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this, we are plainly told, that Christ was <hi>before Abraham:</hi> nay, <hi>before all things:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>before the world was;</hi> and do not these Texts undeniably prove the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of his Existence? No, saith this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian;</hi> these Texts prove no more
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65890:111"/> than this: namely, that Christ was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things in the Foreordination, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and Counsel of God, but not that he was so in Actual being and Pre-existence.</hi> And to confirm this, he cites the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.</note> who saith of Christ, <hi>He verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in these last times;</hi> from whence this Man draws this worthy Inference, <hi>no foreordained being can be eternal, since he, that did ordain his being, must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him of necessity:</hi> To which I thus reply:</p>
            <p>In what capacity and respect our Lord was <hi>foreordained</hi> according to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s meaning, we must judg by the <hi>Contexture</hi> and Coherence of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; where in the foregoing Verse having mentioned, <hi>The precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without spot;</hi> he immediately adds these words, <hi>who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world.</hi> 'Tis very evident from the Connexion of this Verse with the former, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> of Christ, that innocent Lamb of God, who was designed to Redeem

               <hi>the Lamb slain from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world:</hi> So that the only thing here intended by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and said to be foreordained, was the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> of Christ with all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, and particularly that great one of his <hi>Death</hi> and Passion: and from hence no good Inference can be drawn against our Lord's <hi>Eternity;</hi> for this foreordination of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature and the Consequences of it can prove no more, than that his <hi>Humanity,</hi> being the thing <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained,</hi> was of a <hi>later date</hi> than he who did foreordain it, and who can doubt it?</p>
            <p>And whereas this Man would fain elude the force of that Text, where our Lord saith, <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith of Christ, <hi>He was before all things,</hi> by telling us, that so he was in the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,</hi> Decree, and Counsel of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65890:112"/> God; I answer, if that were all which our <hi>Lord</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant by those Expressions, then did they say no more of <hi>Christ,</hi> than this <hi>Clock-maker,</hi> or any Man else, may say of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> for before <hi>Abraham</hi> was in Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al being, nay, before any thing was created, every Man, as well as the <hi>Man Christ</hi> Jesus, was in God's <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,</hi> Decree, and Counsel. But when our Lord said, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am,</hi> and when St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>He was before all things;</hi> whether they meant no more in reference to our Lord, than what is common to <hi>all</hi> mankind, I leave to the Judgment of every Person, who hath not utterly abandoned his own reason; who is not <hi>wedded,</hi> or rather quite <hi>enslaved,</hi> to an ill Opinion.</p>
            <p>But this Author is not ashamed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that if the Sense of these Texts be not, as he interprets them, <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict both common understanding, and the greatest and plainest part of all the Bible.</hi> This Intimation is very bold and very false; for, if the sense of these Texts, different from this Man's
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65890:113"/> Interpretation, do indeed Contradict common understanding, how came so many Expositors, Men of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Learning and acute Judgments, to Interpret these Texts, as we do?</p>
            <p>I remember that <hi>Gregory Nazienzene</hi> begins his <hi>Panegyrick</hi> in praise of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> thus,<note place="margin">Gregorius Naz. de laudibus Athanas.</note>

               </gap>, for he had <hi>all</hi> Virtue comprehended in him. But notwithstanding all his Excellencies, I know that our <hi>Socinians</hi> hate his Writings, and to render his <hi>works</hi> the less valuable, they slander his <hi>Person,</hi> and very undeservedly bespatter his <hi>memory</hi> what they can.

            <p>The question then is, how doth this Man of more than vulgar Reason In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret those words of Christ, <hi>Before
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65890:113"/> Abraham was, I am?</hi> How? In God's <hi>foreordination,</hi> and no otherwise? What thought <hi>Athanasius?</hi>

It seems then that this great Man was throughly satisfied in his own judgment, that these words of Christ, <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am,</hi> are an infallible evidence of our Lord's <hi>Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because our <hi>Socinians</hi> are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with such a prejudice against the very name of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> as is enough to render his <hi>Authority</hi> insignificant to them; it will not be amiss to add the Testimonies of some other Interpreters, with whom these Men are not so much offended: That of <hi>Theophylact</hi> may be

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; this Title, <hi>I am,</hi> which our Lord here assumes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is peculiar to God, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the Divine Being.</p>

            <p>Of the same mind was that great Man St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who,<note place="margin">Aug. adv.

Again, When our Lord said,<note place="margin">Aug. in <hi>Joan.</hi> c. 8. Tract. 43. Tom. 9. p. 76.</note>
               <hi>Before Abraham was, antequam fieret,</hi> before he was <hi>made, I am;</hi> the same St. <hi>Austin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it thus, <hi>Intellige fieret ad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam naturam, sum verò ad Divinam pertinere substantiam;</hi> the words, <hi>was made,</hi> import <hi>Abraham's Human</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but the word, <hi>am,</hi> imports our Lord's <hi>Divine Substance.</hi> And thus he goeth on, <hi>Qui loquebatur, semen Abraha factus erat; &amp; ut Abraham fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eret, ante Abraham ipse erat:</hi> Our Lord, who spake these words, was made the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that <hi>Abraham</hi> might be made, our Lord in <hi>Actual</hi> being was before him.</p>
            <p>And that these words must needs be thus understood, is evident from the context; for they are a direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the <hi>Jews</hi> question: <hi>Thou art

            <p>To these Authorities I shall add but one Testimony more, which saith of Christ,<note place="margin">Maldona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in eun. locum.</note>
               <hi>quamvis, ut homo erat, nondum</hi> 50 <hi>haberet annos, tamen esse praeterea Deum, qui non solùm ante Abraham, sed ante omnia etiam saecula extitisset.</hi> Though our Lord, as <hi>Man,</hi> was not yet 50 years old; yet, as being <hi>God</hi> also, he was, not only before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but before <hi>all</hi> Ages.</p>
            <p>And now let this <hi>Socinian</hi> Scribler tell us, whether these forenamed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who interpret this Text, as we do, judging it to be a plain evidence of our Lord's <hi>Eternity,</hi> were not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at least of <hi>common understanding;</hi> but if they were more than so, Men of <hi>excellent parts</hi> and accurate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; why is not this Man ashamed to say, that this Text, so understood, contradicts the <hi>common reason</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? But I am of Opinion, that they, who interpret it another way, do
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65890:115"/> want, either the <hi>common reason</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> or the <hi>common honesty</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Trifler</hi> stops not here, but goeth on to tell us, that this Text, being interpreted as an Evidence of our Lord's <hi>Actual</hi> being before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of his <hi>Eternity,</hi> doth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the greatest and plainest part of all the Bible: So he.</p>
            <p>'Tis commonly said, <hi>Dolus latet in Universalibus:</hi> This Charge, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>General,</hi> without some <hi>particular</hi> Proofs signifies nothing. It was indeed our Author's great Prudence not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in any particular Passages of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, because he can never prove, that any <hi>one</hi> Text is contradicted by our Interpretation of this. When our Lord saith, <hi>Before Abraham was, I am;</hi> We affirm, that this Text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports our Lord's <hi>Eternity;</hi> that's our Interpretation of it, nor do we know any other Text that contradicts it; but we do know several Texts, which agree very fairly with it, and confirm it. So doth that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where 'tis generally supposed, that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, under the Title of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> speaks thus of himself,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.2.</note>
               <hi>I was set up from Everlasting;</hi> so undoubtedly doth that of the Prophet, where the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:65890:116"/> is said to be one, <hi>whose goings forth have been of old, from the days of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> so doth that of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> which the Apostle applieth to Christ: <hi>Thou,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10.</note>
               <hi>Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. So doth that of St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.</note>
               <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> &amp;c. and so doth that of St. <hi>Paul, By him were all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth,</hi> &amp;c. All these Scriptures do unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably prove our Lord's Eternity, either in <hi>express Terms,</hi> or by <hi>necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences;</hi> and since they do so, they do fairly correspond and suit with our Interpretation of these words of Christ, <hi>Before Abraham was, I am,</hi> my Being is Eternal.</p>
            <p>Now, to retort this Objection, and to speak a little, <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> to the Man, that raised it; St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi>

               <hi>and the word was with God, and the word was God;</hi> and certainly if our Lord was God in the beginning, he is so still, and will be so to the end. St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who knew him well, called him, <hi>My Lord,</hi>

               <hi>O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> These Texts do assert the Divinity of Christ in as plain words, as can well be utter'd; and yet this Man, in defiance of these and other Divine Testimonies, which can never be understood in any other tolerable sense, dares lay down this as an undoubted Conclusion; <hi>That Christ is not truly God: Who then contradicts the Scriptures, we, or he?</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ is the next thing, which this Author pleads against; nor can we wonder that he, who denyeth our Lord's <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> should also deny his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> which wholly depends upon it; for, thus we argue, <hi>If Christ had not been God, the sacrifice, which he offered for sinners, would not have been of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite worth, which was necessary to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the infinite Justice of an offended God.</hi>

            <p>Doubtless this Argument can never be overthrown; nor can those Texts,

            <p>To all these and the like Texts, which import our Lord's <hi>satisfaction,</hi> this Man was not able to answer any thing, save
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65890:117"/> only to say, <hi>These are but improper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;</hi> and why might he not as well have said, we are but <hi>improperly redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, improperly saved; Putative,</hi> as those old Hereticks <hi>Cerdon</hi> and <hi>Marcion</hi> affirmed, <hi>In shew,</hi> not at all? for, if the Divine Justice be not <hi>properly</hi> and completely satisfied, no Flesh can be saved.</p>
            <p>But, as to disprove the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of Christ, this Man endeavours to elude those Texts, which do confirm it; so to the same end doth he frame an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> against it, and this it is, <hi>If Christ had made in our stead such a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as had been equivalent to the Transgressions of all men, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them, how then could life eternal be the free gift of God? how then could we be saved by free Grace? and how could our sins be said to be forgiven?</hi> So he: to which I answer, free Gift, free Grace, are very consistent with that perfect sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which our Lord hath made to the Justice of God. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Lord himself, who made this satisfaction, was the <hi>free Gift</hi> of God, who first of his own mere motion and goodness promised him without any expectation or <hi>desire,</hi> and afterward sent him without any <hi>merit</hi> in Man. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65890:118"/> the Evangelist tells us, <hi>God gave his only begotten Son;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Esa.</hi> 9.6.</note> and our Lord stiles himself, <hi>the Gift of God:</hi> and the Prophet saith, <hi>unto us a Son is given.</hi> And since our Lord <hi>himself</hi> was freely given us, all the <hi>Benefits,</hi> which we receive by him and from him, must be so too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was <hi>free Grace</hi> in God the <hi>Son,</hi> that he was willing to <hi>make,</hi> and in God the <hi>Father,</hi> that he was willing to <hi>accept,</hi> such a satisfaction from a <hi>Surety,</hi> which he might very justly have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from every one of us, who were the <hi>Principal,</hi> and indeed the <hi>only</hi> deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. So that this blessed exchange did arise merely from the free Grace and good Pleasure of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though the Pardon of Man's sin, and the Salvation of our Souls, <hi>cost</hi> our <hi>Surety</hi> very dear; yet this glorious purchase comes very <hi>cheap</hi> to us, who pay nothing for it: for all the <hi>service,</hi> that we can do; all the <hi>Thanks,</hi> that we can return; are very justly due to God upon <hi>other</hi> accounts.</p>
            <p>And this I think is enough to answer this Man's Objection; who yet at last hath found out another way, and he thinks a very full one, to satisfie the <hi>Justice</hi> of God, and consequently to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65890:118"/> render the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; for, thus he writes, <hi>The Justice of God is fully satisfied in the certain pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Transgression; for</hi> Adam <hi>died, and we all die; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence his Justice, as to that offence, is satisfied in all its demands; so satisfied, that this</hi> Man saith, <hi>'Tis plain that God in equity can require no more:</hi> So he.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Much the same thing is meant by <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And indeed there is very great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why this Sentence should reach the Soul of <hi>Adam;</hi> 'tis justly said, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in Peccato, Pares in Poena:</hi> They, who have an equal share in the <hi>Sin,</hi> should have an equal share in the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> Now, the truth is, the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of every Man else, hath the far greater share in all Sin; for the

               </gap>, the Soul's <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, Animae famulus,</hi> the Soul's <hi>Servant:</hi> 'Tis the Soul, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and enables the Body according to her own inclinations; and if the <hi>Body</hi> smart for acting amiss, is it fit that the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is the Spring of every Action, should quite escape? Certain it is, if a <hi>Temporal</hi> Death had been the only Punishment of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, his <hi>Soul,</hi> though deepest in the Guilt, yet, being <hi>immortal,</hi> must have gone unpunished.</p>
            <p>And for this reason the Jewish <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> as <hi>Fagius</hi> cites them, did grant,<note place="margin">Fagius ubi supra.</note>
               <hi>Duplici morte Adamum periisse, animae scilicet &amp; corporis; utrumque in homine peccavisse, animam scilicet &amp; corpus, ideo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que utrumque fuisse punitum:</hi> That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> perished with a <hi>double</hi> Death, that of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and that of the <hi>Body</hi> too; that he sinned in <hi>both,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was punished in <hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, though <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body died, yet must it be raised again, and be made Immortal; and since <hi>Adam</hi>'s Flesh, and every Man's else, must be re-united to their Spirits, and so exist without any End; if a Temporal Death were the only Punishment of Sin, the Resurrection would determine and put
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65890:120"/> a final Period to it; and consequently there must be an Eternal Punishment in another World, unless we grant that the most profligate Wretches, who must be raised again and exist for ever, as well as the most vertuous and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, shall be equally and eternally happy; for, as to a middle State, there is none.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this, our <hi>Socinian</hi> Author, according to his usual Confidence, makes bold to say, <hi>Hell is the Punishment, which is due to the breach of the second Covenant, and not of the first,</hi> and by consequence not to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Transgression, which was a breach of the first Covenant only.</p>
            <p>This would be very comfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine indeed, were it not false; for if it were true, it would secure from Hell all those Persons, how wicked so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who are in no capacity to break the second Covenant. The conditions of this second Covenant are Faith in Christ and Repentance towards God; to both which those Nations of the World, who never heard of the Gospel, must needs be strangers. And as for natural Fools, and little Babes, who die in their Infancy, they cannot know what the second Covenant means, nor
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65890:120"/> can they well be said either to break or keep it. Now, as the Laws of Men do not oblige us to Obedience, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the want of it, till first they are made known; so neither doth the Law of the Gospel, or second Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Faith in Christ, or punish the defect of it, where Persons did not, nay could not know it.</p>
            <p>And yet what vast Numbers of such ignorant Persons are there, who mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry and are damned for ever? The Psalmist tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.17.</note>
               <hi>The wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God;</hi> but what should be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? Is it because they did not perform the Conditions of a <hi>second</hi> Covenant, which they never heard of? that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; the <hi>want</hi> of a Christian <hi>faith,</hi> and an Evangelical <hi>Repentance</hi> is not the <hi>Original</hi> cause of any Man's <hi>Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but because Faith and Repentance are <hi>Secunda post naufragium tabula,</hi> the only means to prevent that Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which we have <hi>otherwise</hi> deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: the want of them doth <hi>leave</hi> men under that <hi>guilt,</hi> which they have <hi>alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> contracted; and expose them to that Eternal Punishment, which they have <hi>already</hi> deserved by breaking the <hi>first</hi> Covenant, whose Terms run thus, <hi>Do
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65890:121"/> this,</hi> and <hi>live;</hi> but if not, <hi>die</hi> and be <hi>damned</hi> for ever, for so the Scriptures do often explain it.</p>
            <p>We cannot reasonably doubt, but the Grace and Mercy offered in the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Covenant was designed to deliver Mankind from that <hi>Curse,</hi> whereunto our Violation of the <hi>first</hi> Covenant had too justly rendred all Men obnoxious. Our Lord is called the <hi>Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 1.29.</note> and that sin before our Saviour's time, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but the Transgression of the <hi>natural Law</hi> amongst the <hi>Heathens,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon their Hearts, and a fairer Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same delivered to <hi>Moses,</hi> with some positive Precepts among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, our Lord's business was, as the Angel said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21.</note>
               <hi>to save his People from their sins,</hi> from the Dominion, Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Guilt and Punishment of those Sins, with which the World then did, and still doth abound, through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Breaches of the <hi>first</hi> Covenant, or Law of <hi>works.</hi> For that the <hi>moral</hi> Law is still in force, and that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of <hi>Hell</hi> are due to the Breach of this Law, this doting <hi>Scribler</hi> would not deny, were he not a <hi>double Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;</hi> an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> as well as a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:65890:121"/> But were not this Law still in force, to what end did our Lord think fit to <hi>explain</hi> it? were it not still in force, how came our Blessed Saviour to recommend the punctual <hi>observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of it, as the ready way to Heaven and Happiness? and how came the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to press Obedience to it with so much Zeal, and the strongest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that could be thought on?</p>
            <p>And if the Punishments of <hi>Hell</hi> were not due, as this Man boldly asserts, to the Transgression of this Law, how comes St. <hi>Paul</hi> to tell us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</note>
               <hi>Cursed is every one, that continueth not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law to do them?</hi> 'Tis evident from this Text, that the least Breach of this Law doth expose the Transgressors of it to the <hi>curse</hi> of God; and what that Curse contains, is evident from that Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting Fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.10</note> Accordingly our Lord, who is said, To redeem us from the Curse of the Law, is also said, <hi>To deliver us from the wrath to come,</hi> and doth not that import the Punishments of Hell?</p>
            <p>And indeed if our Lord had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from that <hi>Eternal</hi> Wrath, whereunto the Breaches of the <hi>first</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant had exposed us, he had shed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65890:122"/> his Blood in vain, and had delivered us from nothing at all: for from those Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are due to final <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence</hi> and Unbelief, which are the grand Breaches of the <hi>second</hi> Covenant, there is no Man redeemed by any thing, which Christ hath done or suffered for us. Nay, 'tis so far from this, that a Man's refusal of that Grace and Mercy, which is offered to him upon the Terms of Faith and Repentance by the <hi>second</hi> Covenant, doth <hi>double</hi> that <hi>damnation,</hi> which he had deserved by breaking the <hi>first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that the Breach of the <hi>first</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth indeed deserve the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Hell,</hi> and that Christ hath freed all believers from it, this incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Author will not grant, because our Lord hath not freed believers from the <hi>Grave;</hi> for thus he saith, <hi>'Tis strange that Christ should free believers from one part of the Punishment, and not from the other;</hi> and then he adds, <hi>The Scriptures no where reveal this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and for that reason we need not believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why this should seem a thing so very strange, what good reason can this Man give us? did he never hear of any merciful <hi>Prince,</hi> who spared a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65890:122"/>
               <hi>condemn'd</hi> Malefactor, as to his <hi>life,</hi> the loss whereof would have been his greatest Punishment, and yet, to make him the more sensible of his Crimes, detained him in <hi>prison</hi> perhaps all his days? doubtless 'tis an Act of Grace to give a condemned Traytor his <hi>life,</hi> though his <hi>liberty</hi> be denied him. So in our present case, it was infinite Mercy in our Lord to rescue us from <hi>Hell,</hi> that place of Torment, though he should never free us from the <hi>Grave;</hi> which to a good Man is but <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And as for Death, a religious man need not dread it; for to him,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Our friend Lazarus sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> and what harm is there in that? When a good man has done his day's work, and is wearied with the drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of this World, can it be any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to him, in the Evening of his Life to lie down and fall asleep?

And if this be the Case of dying Saints, 'tis not, as this man thinks, strange at all, that our Lord, who hath secured them from <hi>Hell,</hi> hath not also saved them from <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord hath told us, and there is great reason for it; <hi>It is enough for the servant to be as his Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.25</note> and if so, can it be strange that our Lord should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Servants to <hi>die,</hi> and lie in the <hi>Dust</hi> for a while, since he <hi>himself,</hi> and for their sakes, hath done so before them? If we consider, that our Blessed Saviour hath <hi>warmed</hi> our <hi>cold</hi> Bed, and

               <hi>perfumed</hi> our <hi>Grave</hi> by lying in it; if we consider that he hath plucked out the <hi>sting</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and made it fit to be entertained within our <hi>bosoms;</hi> if we consider what will be the blessed and <hi>immediate consequences</hi> of our disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; every good man hath reason enough to esteem it, not as a part of his <hi>punishment</hi> now, though at first it was so, but as his <hi>privilege</hi> rather.</p>
            <p>But, saith this bold Author, <hi>The Scriptures do no where reveal this secret, and for that reason, we need not believe it:</hi> I answer, this is <hi>no secret,</hi> for the Holy Scriptures have very plainly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> it, and therefore we are obliged to believe it.</p>
            <p>That our Lord hath not excused the very best of Men from Death and the Grave; the Scripture tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 8.52. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.10</note>
               <hi>Abraham is dead,</hi> and <hi>the Prophets are dead,</hi> and in <hi>general, Death hath passed upon all men:</hi> But the same Scripture tells us, that our Lord hath secured all <hi>good</hi> men from <hi>Hell;</hi> what else doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> mean, when he saith, <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them who are in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;</hi> and again, <hi>Jesus delivers us from the wrath to come:</hi> 'Tis very evident from these and the like Texts, that our Lord hath indeed delivered all

            <p>THis Author, observing no Rules of Method, doth now abruptly attack another Argument used by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines, to prove the Divinity of Christ, and this it is:</p>
            <p>That Person, who hath been worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by good men, and ought to be so, is God: But our Blessed Saviour is a Person, that hath been worshiped by good men, and ought to be so; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Our blessed Saviour is God.</p>
            <p>The major Proposition being indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, for the proof of the Minor two things must be shewed: 1. The <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> that out Lord hath been religiously worshiped in the most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly times of the Gospel by very good men. 2. That our Lord <hi>ought</hi> to be so worshiped.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Lord hath been religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously worshiped by very good men, even from the very Infancy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, is very evident from several Texts. Those early Saints, who lived in the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Days, are described by this Character. They,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 9.10.</note>
               <hi>Who called upon thy Name</hi> — the Name of <hi>Christ;</hi> such as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65890:125"/>
               <hi>petitioned,</hi> gave <hi>thanks</hi> to him, both which are Acts of <hi>Divine</hi> Adoration.</p>
            <p>To this and the like Texts this man hath nothing to answer, save only this: <hi>'Tis hard to understand what is there meant by calling upon the Name of Christ:</hi> but why so hard? Doth not the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar use of that same Phrase in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Scriptures make its Sense ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, plain, and easie? when the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> complain'd of the Irreligion of the Heathen World, and expressed it thus; <hi>They have not called upon thy Name:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ps.</hi> 79.6.</note> did he not mean, that they had not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that <hi>worship</hi> to God, which was his due?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13</note> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall call upon the Name of the Lord, shall be saved;</hi> doth he not mean such Persons as <hi>offer</hi> up their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> to God, which are the chiefest parts of religious <hi>Worship?</hi> and if this be the usual Sense of this Phrase in these and many other Texts, who is it hard to think, that it should be of the same sense in this?</p>
            <p>Well, if such solemn <hi>Invocations</hi> be indeed such Acts of <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> which are due to none but <hi>God;</hi> 'tis evident that our Lord hath been esteemed a <hi>God</hi> by those pious Men, who made their <hi>Religious Addresses</hi> to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65890:125"/> him. Whilst he converted here below, he was <hi>petitioned</hi> for such <hi>favours,</hi> as none could bestow but a <hi>God.</hi> Thus prayed the Father of a distressed Child, <hi>Lord, help my unbelief;</hi> nay, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample more considerable, so prayed the Apostles: <hi>They said unto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.5.</note>
               <hi>increase our faith;</hi> 'Tis sure, that <hi>faith</hi> is the gift of <hi>God,</hi> and so is that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which, after our Lord's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, St. <hi>Paul</hi> so often begged, <hi>from God the father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And methinks that dying <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomartyr</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who prayed thus, <hi>Lord Jesus receive my spirit,</hi> should put this matter beyond all question.</p>
            <p>Now, can we think that all these Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, who wanted and begged such great favours; especially they, who were <hi>inspired</hi> men, should <hi>mistake</hi> their <hi>benefactor,</hi> address themselves to a wrong Person, and begg such <hi>boons</hi> at a <hi>wrong door?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as good men in the Primitive times, and indeed ever since, have been wont to petition Christ for a supply of their greatest wants; so now, even <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> do for ever <hi>bless</hi> him, as well as <hi>Saints</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> for such supplies, especially for those matchless kindnesses, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

               <hi>To him that loved us, and washt us from our sins in his blood, be Glory and Power for ever and ever;</hi> And so again,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Now, since <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praises,</hi> which are the main parts of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship,</hi> have been and still are, offered up to <hi>Christ</hi> by the very best of men on <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> this is enough to clear the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> and convince this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that our Lord hath been <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously</hi> worshiped, and is so still.</p>
            <p>But, saith this <hi>Socinian Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer,</hi> no such Worship is due to Christ, nor ought a Divine Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be paid unto him; and for this he gives us two Reasons, such as they are; 1. The first is this, <hi>The Scriptures do no where injoin us to make Christ the Object of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> 2. His second Reason is this; <hi>The Scriptures do rather expresly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the contrary,</hi> the worshiping of Christ is more clearly <hi>forbidden</hi> than <hi>required;</hi> so he: To both which I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:65890:126"/>1. That the Scriptures do no where require us to make Christ the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> is an assertion, that is utterly false; for we find several <hi>commands</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>We read that <hi>Ananias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in locum</note> a devout man, and, as a learned Writer saith, one of the <hi>seventy</hi> Disciples, and a <hi>Deacon</hi> at <hi>Damascus,</hi> was sent by a special Commission to <hi>Saul,</hi> to give him this Command: <hi>Arise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16</note>
               <hi>and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the Name of the Lord.</hi> Here <hi>Invocation,</hi> a solemn Act of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> is required, and the <hi>Object</hi> of it is the <hi>Lord;</hi> but what Lord is it? Doubtless the same Lord, who had appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in the way, and now sent <hi>Ananias</hi> to him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our blessed Saviour; so thought St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who thus expounds it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, calling upon the Name of <hi>Christ;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chrysosto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> and by this injunction did <hi>Ananias,</hi> in effect, assure <hi>Saul</hi> that Christ is <hi>God,</hi> since it is not lawful <hi>religiously</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> any other Name, but that of God; so that these words of <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Saul, Wash away thy sins, calling on the Name
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65890:127"/> of the Lord,</hi> do, in St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, import thus much: That bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Person, whose Name is <hi>Jesus,</hi> whom thou hast lately persecuted, do thou now <hi>petition</hi> for thy pardon, do thou now <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him as thy God.</p>
            <p>But if this Command from <hi>Ananias,</hi> though an <hi>inspired</hi> Person, were not a sufficient warrant for us to invoke, pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tition, and worship our blessed Saviour, we have another from <hi>himself;</hi> for thus he tells us, <hi>All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> I have already proved in another Section, that this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>even as,</hi> doth import <gap reason="foreign">

And if so, since God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is, and ought to be honoured with a <hi>Religious Worship;</hi> this Text commands us to honour the <hi>Son</hi> so too.</p>
            <p>In short, the <hi>Father</hi> himself hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired such an Honour for his <hi>Son:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us so. <hi>When he bringeth his first begotten into the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.</note> he saith, <hi>let all the Angels of God worship him:</hi> Certainly if <hi>Angels,</hi> who of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the <hi>Noblest,</hi> and not the most <hi>obliged</hi> to our Blessed Saviour, must
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65890:127"/> worship him notwithstanding; then are <hi>poor</hi> men, his <hi>only redeemed</hi> ones, much more bound to do so.</p>
            <p>'Tis the known Precept both of the Law and the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10</note>
               <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God;</hi> This is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be every man's indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable Duty; and if so, then all those Texts, which do assure us that Christ is our <hi>Lord</hi> and our <hi>God,</hi> do not only <hi>warrant,</hi> but implicitly and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially they do <hi>command</hi> us to pay him all that reverential respect and <hi>Religious</hi> Service, which is justly due to <hi>God.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Author is so far from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of this, that he tells us, <hi>the Scriptures do rather intimate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> they rather <hi>forbid</hi> than <hi>require</hi> the worshiping of Christ.</p>
            <p>To prove this, he cites our Lord's own words to his Disciples:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22.</note>
               <hi>In that day ye shall ask me nothing,</hi> from hence doth this man conclude, that our Lord forewarned his Disciples to pray to him, to beg any thing from him after his Ascension. To which I answer;</p>
            <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Original Language; and the word <hi>Ask,</hi> in our own Tongue, are used in a double Sense; 1. They both do sometimes
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65890:128"/> signify to <hi>enquire,</hi> or propound a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in case of <hi>doubt.</hi> 2. They both do sometimes signify to <hi>crave</hi> an Alms, to beg a <hi>gift</hi> in case of <hi>want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. These words do sometimes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to <hi>enquire,</hi> or propound a question in any case of doubt; and thus they are used in many places of the New Testament.</p>
            <p>And of this Sense doth this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Text seem to be very fairly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for our Lord's Apostles had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto propounded several questions to him; <hi>Lord, whither goest thou?</hi> said St. <hi>Peter: Lord, who is it, that shall betray thee?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh</hi> 13.36. V. 25.</note> So St. <hi>John; Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thy self unto us, and not to the World?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That this first Sense of these words in this Text is at least very <hi>allowable,</hi> is the opinion of judicious men;<note place="margin">Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactus in locum.</note>
               <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> expounds it thus; <hi>ye shall ask

               <hi>non dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quin hoc loco pro Interrogare positum sit:</hi> There is no doubt, but when our Lord saith, <hi>ye shall ask me nothing,</hi> he means no more <hi>questions;</hi> for, saith he, <hi>Nullis jam questionibus locus erit, omnia vobis mysteria patefient, ità ut ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil vobis opus sit interrogare:</hi> There shall then be no more occasion for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,</hi> all Mysteries shall be plainly revealed unto you, so that ye shall have no need to move any further <hi>questions.</hi>

            <p>So also do our own Interpreters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this Text, as if our Lord had said, <hi>When that spirit is come,</hi>

               <hi>he shall

               <hi>When ye shall see me risen from the dead, ye shall not then enquire of me those things, which ye now doubt of; you shall be taught of the Holy Ghost, and so understand these things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if these words of Christ, <hi>ye shall ask me nothing,</hi> relate, not to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> in cases of <hi>want,</hi> but to <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in cases of <hi>doubt;</hi> then is this Text very impertinently cited by this Man, to prove that the Scriptures do rather <hi>forbid</hi> than <hi>require</hi> us to make Christ the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> by praying to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. These words <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>As to the use of these words in this particular Text, St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> puts the question thus; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, what means our Lord, when he saith, <hi>ye shall ask me nothing?</hi> he adswers, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Joan. Tract. 101. <hi>p.</hi> 107.

Such an Inference from this Text, that great man St. <hi>Austin</hi> disclaims, and that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65890:130"/> with heat of zeal and indignation; for thus he writes: <hi>Quis andeat vel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitare, vel dicere, in coelo sedentem Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum rogandum non esse? rogandum non esse Immortalem, rogari debuisse morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?</hi> What man dares to <hi>say,</hi> nay, to <hi>think</hi> that Christ, now sitting in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may not be invoked? was he to be petitioned even <hi>then,</hi> when he was a <hi>mortal</hi> man, and may he not be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned <hi>now</hi> in the State of his <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Augustinus ibidem.</note> yes, St. <hi>Austin</hi> adviseth us to it, and that in relation to this very Text, which, as this man saith, doth rather forbid it; for, thus that Father writes: <hi>Rogemus eum, ut nodum quaestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis hujus ipse dissolvat, lucendo in cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nostris, ad videnda quae dicit:</hi> Let us <hi>pray</hi> to Christ, and <hi>beg,</hi> that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would untie this hard knot, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning our minds, that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the true meaning of those things which he here delivers.</p>
            <p>But whatever the sense of these words may be, if our Lord did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>forbid</hi> his Apostles to ask any thing of him after his Ascension, either they did not <hi>understand</hi> this Command, or else they <hi>knowingly</hi> and frequently <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed</hi> it; but we cannot reasonably charge them either with such gross
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65890:130"/>
               <hi>ignorance,</hi> or with such wilful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Acts of <hi>disobedience</hi> to a known Command of that Lord, for obeying whom they laid down their Lives.</p>
            <p>We read that our Lord, having blest his Apostles, was parted from them, and went up to Heaven; and what then? the next news is this:<note place="margin">

            <p>In short, since these words of Christ, <hi>ye shall ask me nothing,</hi> are difficult to be understood; since the word, <hi>Ask,</hi> is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a word of <hi>various</hi> significations; and sometimes in case of <hi>want,</hi> and sometimes in case of <hi>doubt;</hi> and since in this later sense 'tis generally thought to be most applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this particular Text; 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible from hence to draw a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive Argument against our making Christ the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> by offering up our <hi>Prayers</hi> to him; an Act, whereunto we are the more encouraged by the great <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>inspired</hi> men, who, since the delivery of these words, <hi>ye shall ask me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> directed their <hi>Petitions</hi> to him, and <hi>adored</hi> him, as <hi>God,</hi> by their solemn and religious <hi>Invocations.</hi>

            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:65890:131"/>
            <p>This man doth here seem to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Practice, which he obliquely imputes to us, who make Christ the Object of our Worship, as if we put him instead of the true God, and made him <hi>alone</hi> the Object of our Prayers and Thanksgivings. This Imputation is utterly false and altogether unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; for, indeed we cannot put Christ instead of the <hi>true</hi> God, except we can put him instead of <hi>himself;</hi> for the true God he is, and St. <hi>John</hi> plainly tells us so. Nor do we make the Person of Christ <hi>alone</hi> the Object of our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings;</hi> for we pray to the <hi>whole</hi> Trinity; sometimes <hi>severally</hi> to <hi>each</hi> Person, and sometimes <hi>jointly</hi> to them <hi>all.</hi> And in our <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies</hi> and Thanksgivings our known form is this, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;</hi> and how then do we make Christ <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> the Object of our Worship?</p>
            <p>Nor do we by this Practice, as this man slanderously insinuates, do any thing, which tends to deprive our Lord of his <hi>Mediatorship;</hi> we own, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth; <hi>That there is One,</hi> and, but <hi>One Mediatour betwixt God and Man, even, the Man Christ Jesus:</hi> We pray to him as our <hi>Advocate</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>If <hi>we are to believe Mysteries, when clearly revealed, yet that doth not oblige us to believe Impossibilities and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions;</hi> I answer,</p>
            <p>That we are to believe <hi>Mysteries,</hi> when clearly revealed from Heaven, is so certain a Truth, that if this Man doubt it, as he seems to do, he is an <hi>Infidel,</hi> as well as an <hi>Heretick.</hi> But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that we are so to believe, yet, saith he, <hi>it doth not from thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65890:132"/> that therefore we must believe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities and Contradictions.</hi> His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, as is evident from the Design of his whole Book, that we are not bound to believe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> because, in his opinion, there are <hi>Impossibilities</hi> and <hi>Contradictions</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>But doth this presuming <hi>Mechanick</hi> perfectly understand the <hi>Infinite</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the incomprehensible God? Can he give us a just Account of his <hi>Eternity</hi> without <hi>Succession?</hi> Or his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence</hi> without <hi>Extension?</hi> Can he tell us, how any Being should be <hi>of</hi> and <hi>from</hi> it self, and yet such a Being there must be, and that without a Beginning? If this man doth not fully comprehend the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, the <hi>Infinity</hi> of his Essence, and the <hi>Extent</hi> of his unlimited Power, how dares he charge that Doctrin with <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities</hi> and <hi>Contradictions,</hi> which this great God hath so <hi>clearly</hi> and so <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> revealed for a certain Truth, and which this man doth not, cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>But the Truth is, there is nothing of <hi>Contradiction</hi> in what the Scriptures deliver concerning the <hi>Trinity;</hi> we are there told that there is but <hi>One</hi> true
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65890:133"/> God, and we believe it; we are also there as plainly told, that there are <hi>Three</hi> Persons in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and we do equally believe that too, and so have the generality of good men done before us.<note place="margin">Epiphan. in Pan.

In the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures the Trinity is declared unto us, and is believed, and that without any curious <hi>Questions</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> about it; and so it was in the Ages before him; so he intimates elsewhere:<note place="margin">Epiphan. in Pan. adv.

               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are <hi>Three</hi> Holy ones, <hi>Three</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy, <hi>Three</hi> Subsistences, <hi>Three</hi> equal Subsistences, being each joined to one another, being of one Consent, one
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65890:133"/> Godhead, and the same Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but then he adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But as to the <hi>manner, how</hi> this should be, it must be left to these blessed Persons themselves to to <hi>teach</hi> us.</p>
            <p>And since the Doctrin of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath in all Ages been received as an undoubted Article of our Christian Faith, by the Generality of judicious men; we may conclude, that they, who believed it, discovered no <hi>Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities,</hi> no <hi>Contradictions</hi> in it; and if there were none in their Ages, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin being still the same, there can be none in ours. Indeed, were we told, that there is but <hi>One</hi> God, and yet that there are <hi>Three</hi> Gods, this were a plain Contradiction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently impossible that both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions should be true; but when we are told, that there is but <hi>One</hi> God, and yet <hi>Three</hi> Persons, each of which is God, there is no Contradiction in this; because their <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Infinite Perfections are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically the same. And although our shallow understanding cannot dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this deep Mystery, nor apprehend <hi>how</hi> it should be so; yet ought we to be so far from judging it <hi>impossible,</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:65890:134"/> that we are obliged firmly to <hi>believe</hi> that so it is, because it is as clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Scriptures, and I think as consonant to humane Reason, as some <hi>other</hi> Articles of our Faith, which yet most men within the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to believe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Dead</hi> is a Doctrin attended with such <hi>Intricacies,</hi> and so many Difficulties, that humane Reason scarce knoweth how to admit it for a certain truth, though indeed it be so. In St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time it was thought to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a thing <hi>Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Origen. contra l. 5. p. 24. Edit. Cantabrig.</note> and <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Origin</hi> stiles it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a thing <hi>impossible,</hi> and yet we believe, not only that it <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>must</hi> be. Now, as there are some things in Nature, which are looked upon as <hi>Types,</hi> Emblems, and Representations of the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> so likewise are there some instances in Nature, which, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be urged as <hi>proofs</hi> for the <hi>certainty,</hi> yet may serve as useful <hi>illustrations</hi> to help our weak Apprehensions, and somewhat <hi>facilitate</hi> our belief as to the <hi>Possibility</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; there is in every living Man a <hi>Rational,</hi> a <hi>Sensitive,</hi> and a <hi>Vegetive</hi> Soul; and yet the Soul of Man is but <hi>One;</hi> so here, there is in the Deity a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65890:134"/>
               <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Son,</hi> and an <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and yet the Deity is but <hi>One.</hi> Only here is the difference, <hi>Reason, Sense,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation,</hi> are but <hi>three essential</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Faculties,</hi> or Powers of one and the same <hi>Soul;</hi> whereas, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are <hi>three</hi> essential and distinct <hi>subsistences</hi> in one and the same <hi>Godhead;</hi> and for the belief of this, the Scripture is our only <hi>Authentick</hi> Warrant.</p>
            <p>But that we have there any such Warrant, this man denieth, and like one out of his wits tells us, <hi>When a Mystery is plainly expressed in some places of Scripture, if others more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and plain had affirmed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or had it been contradicted by any self-evident Principle of Reason, we might then have rejected the belief thereof as safely, and with as good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as we now do that of the Popish Transubstantiation, which by the way is as expresly contained in Scripture, as is that of the Trinity;</hi> so he. To which I answer: In this expression there is both <hi>Blalphemy</hi> and <hi>Falshood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In this expression there is <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> and it lieth in that vile suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of his, <hi>When a Mystery is plainly revealed in some places of Scripture, if
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65890:135"/> others more numerous and plain had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the contrary;</hi> in plain English, <hi>had God contradicted himself,</hi> a sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion so <hi>blasphemous,</hi> a supposition so abominable, that he who raised it, <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>deserves</hi> a Room in <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> or in some other <hi>Mad-house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this supposition can no way tend to promote this man's accursed Design; for, it doth insinuate, that the <hi>mysterious</hi> Doctrin of the Trinity, which concession is enough for us, is <hi>plainly revealed</hi> in some places of the Scripture; and although he makes bold to intimate, that it is as plainly <hi>contradicted</hi> in many <hi>more;</hi> yet when he shall be at leisure to shew us that such and such Texts, relating to the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, and clash with one another: We doubt not, but we shall very easily and very fairly reconcile alone, and make up a perfect and lasting Peace, and a very friendly correspondence between them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this expression of his our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor asserts a down-right <hi>Falshood;</hi> for he thus affirms, <hi>The Doctrin of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Transubstantiation, is as expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scripture, as is that of the Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="251" facs="tcp:65890:135"/>
            <p>But is this man a Member of any reformed and <hi>Protestant Church?</hi> could the whole Society of <hi>Jesuits</hi> have said more in favour of their beloved <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> and in so few words, than this man hath done? could he make good, what he hath said, he would well deserve a <hi>Cardinal's Cap,</hi> if not a <hi>Triple Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there lieth a strong Prejudice against this unwarrantable Assertion; for if this Doctrin of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be, as this man saith, as <hi>expresly contained in the Scripture,</hi> as <hi>is that of the Trinity;</hi> how came to it pass, that the one should not be receiv'd and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished as an undoubted Article of the Christian Faith, as <hi>early</hi> as the other? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us thus;<note place="margin">Irenaeus adv.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their Disciples; of whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> was one; who in his Epistles to several Churches, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Inscription of that to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> doth distinctly mention the <hi>Three Persons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which is an Argument that they were all own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65890:136"/> and <hi>adored</hi> as one God in his early Days.</p>
            <p>So that for the general Reception and Belief of the Doctrin of the Trinity, we may justly plead <hi>Prime Antiquity,</hi> even before the Days of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, a Disciple of <hi>Polycarp;</hi> and in the time of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>

But can any Plea of such <hi>Antiquity</hi> be justly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrin of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation?</hi> when this Doctrin first began to be obtruded upon the Church as a necessary Article of the Christian Faith, we have this just Account from the Pen of a learned Man:<note place="margin">Chemnit. in Exam. Concilii gridentini <hi>p.</hi> 271.</note>
               <hi>Innocentius Tertius circa Annum Domini millesimum ducentesimum in Lateranensi Concilio, modum conversionis, ante in Ecclesia non definitum, primus determinavit, &amp; dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati novo novam etiam indidit &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modavit appellationem,</hi> &amp;c. Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the Third about the <hi>Twelfth</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council was the first Man, who determined the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> how the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist are converted, into the <hi>real</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:65890:136"/> Body and Blood of Christ, and to this New Doctrin, never defined till now, he gave and sitted a <hi>new Name,</hi> that of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, may we not here very justly demand, whence was it that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> should be utterly unknown to Prime Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? if it be as expresly contained in the Scripture, as the Doctrin of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> why was <hi>this</hi> so <hi>early</hi> and so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally professed, when the other was not so much as thought on? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the only reason must be this: <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, Clemens Romanus, Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and many other learned Men in the succeeding Ages, could find the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the <hi>Trinity</hi> clearly revealed in the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> but as for that <hi>Monster</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> they could there with their best Eyes find neither the <hi>word,</hi> nor the <hi>thing</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by it.</p>
            <p>For the Truth is, it is not there; 'tis a <hi>New</hi> Doctrin, to which our <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> were perfect Strangers; in all their Writings there is, not only no <hi>sure footing,</hi> but not so much as a <hi>plausible Pretence</hi> for it; 'tis opposed by <hi>Sense,</hi> by <hi>Reason,</hi> by
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65890:137"/> several <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but countenanced by none; insomuch that although some learned Men, out of a base compliance with the Interests of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, plead for it; yet we may justly think that they themselves do not, cannot believe it. The Scriptures, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Doctrin of the <hi>Trinity</hi> are <hi>familiar,</hi> plain, and easie; such as must be understood in their common, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and <hi>literal Sense,</hi> and are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any other tolerable Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But those Texts, which are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cited in favour of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> are <hi>improper, figurative, metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,</hi> and in a literal Sense impossible to be true.</p>
            <p>Such are those expressions of our Blessed Saviour, who said of the <hi>Bread</hi> being then in his <hi>Hand; This is my Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>e are seven years,</hi> and it was a truth, which was thus told St. <hi>John;</hi>

            <pb n="257" facs="tcp:65890:138"/>
            <p>Nor is it any wonder that it should be so; for the Doctrine of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> is grounded upon such Texts, as every man of sense and reason, who is not intoxicated and miserably fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled with groundless Prejudices, must needs acknowledge to be improper and <hi>metonymical;</hi> whereas the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is delivered in such words as are <hi>plain,</hi> easie, and uncapable of any <hi>figure.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>The word was God;</hi> again he saith of Christ, <hi>This is the true God.</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> stiles him, <hi>My Lord, and My God.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles him, <hi>God blessed for ever;</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>There are Three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> and our Lord himself hath named them; the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Now, are not all these Texts, familiar, obvious, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible?

            <p>FRom hence this Author proceeds to discourse of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reason;</hi> and here he tells us, <hi>That our Faith doth not bind us to give our assent to that, which we see no Reason to believe:</hi> And again he saith, <hi>No kind of Faith can be true, which is certainly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</hi> And for that his Argument is this: <hi>The light of Nature is as much God's law, as Divine Revelation, and none must ever think, that God's law can contradict it self:</hi> But why then did this very Man in one of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Paragraphs</hi> suppose it?</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:65890:139"/>
            <p>Well, by all this he means, that we are not obliged by our <hi>Faith</hi> to assert the Doctrine of Christ's <hi>Divinity,</hi> nor consequently to that of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> because <hi>humane</hi> Reason is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to apprehend how one and the same <hi>numerical</hi> Nature should equally subsist in <hi>Three distinct Persons,</hi> and how the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Nature should meet and be united in <hi>One:</hi> To which I answer;</p>
            <p>The ground, rule, and measure of <hi>Theological Faith</hi> is the <hi>Testimony</hi> of God, not <hi>Humane Reason;</hi> and this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Testimony, which is the only standard of saving Faith, is recorded in our Bibles, and we are obliged to believe whatever we find to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered therein for a truth, tho' the matter of it be so <hi>sublime,</hi> that the <hi>low</hi> understanding of Man cannot reach it. It was necessary for the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Nation to give a firm assent to that Prediction, <hi>Behold,</hi>

               <hi>a Virgin shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and bear a Son;</hi> and yet such a Conception and Birth, according to the common Course of Nature, to <hi>Humane Reason</hi> must seem impossible. And are we not all obliged to believe the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of the World out of <hi>nothing,</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Dead</hi> out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65890:140"/> and scattered Atoms, both which have been derided by Men of <hi>great Reason,</hi> as if these great Doctrines were no better than <hi>ridiculous Fables?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when we consider the <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of God, we have all reason undoubtedly to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath revealed for a truth; his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> is sufficient; for, who dares question the <hi>Power</hi> of that great God, who by a <hi>word created</hi> the Universe? and who dares suspect the <hi>Truth</hi> of the same God, for whom it is <hi>impossible to lye?</hi> All that the <hi>Reason</hi> of Man hath to do about Doctrines of <hi>Faith,</hi> is only this; we are to exercise our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to their very utmost ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and to use the very best helps we can get, to find out the true <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of such or such a Text; and when once that is done, whatever Doctrine may be contained in any Text being rightly understood, we must not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute its <hi>possibility,</hi> we must not oppose our own <hi>reasonings</hi> to it, but readily embrace it as an object of our Faith.</p>
            <p>And whereas this Man saith, <hi>The light of Nature is as much God's law, as Divine Revelation;</hi> we grant, that the <hi>primitive</hi> and uncorrupted <hi>light</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture during that very short time of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65890:140"/> Man's Innocence, was so indeed. There was then in Man, as the School-men speak, <hi>Cognitio plena &amp; lucida, clara &amp; fixa contemplatio intelligibilium; Adam,</hi> say they, <hi>habuit scientiam omnium natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter scibilium,</hi> He had the knowledge of all things, which by natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might be known. But is it so with us now? do not even the things of <hi>Nature</hi> and their <hi>occult Qualities</hi> puzzle the most improved understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Men? how was that great Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and perplexed in his uncertain thoughts, about the motions of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus?</hi> was it not the confession of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> that all his natural <hi>light</hi> served only to convince him of his own <hi>darkness</hi> and ignorance, that the only thing, which he certainly knew, was that he knew <hi>nothing?</hi> and how very little doth Man know of <hi>himself?</hi> how little doth he know of <hi>Angels?</hi> and how much less of God? there is still the same <hi>Objectum cognoscibile,</hi> the same objects of knowledge; but our <hi>Virtus cognoscitiva,</hi> our knowing <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is strangely altered for the worse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>light</hi> of Nature, by and ever since <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, hath been <hi>eclipsed;</hi> the <hi>law</hi> of Nature hath been so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65890:141"/>
               <hi>blurred</hi> and blotted, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, being moved by his <hi>own mercy and our necessity,</hi> was pleased to give us a <hi>new</hi> and fairer <hi>Edition</hi> of it in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and expositions of it in other parts of our Bibles. And for this we stand much obliged to Heaven; for the law, <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi> being so strangely obliterated, there was great need of a fresh and clear <hi>Transcript</hi> in the <hi>Book;</hi> the light of Nature was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for a short time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27.</note>
               <hi>the only Candle of the Lord;</hi> but now, there being a <hi>Thief</hi> got into it, and a great deal of <hi>snuff</hi> lying in it; the clearer light of <hi>Revelation</hi> was become so absolutely necessary, that God was pleased to send his <hi>Prophets,</hi> his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and his <hi>own Son,</hi> to inform the World, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie those gross Errors in matters both of <hi>civil Manners</hi> and <hi>religious Worship,</hi> into which the dimm light of Nature had led the generality of Mankind.</p>
            <p>The light of our corrupted Nature is now, at best, but a <hi>small</hi> and <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive</hi> light, and hath often proved a <hi>false</hi> light too; compared with the light of Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> 'tis no more than the light of a <hi>Glow-worm</hi> to that of a <hi>Star,</hi> or the light of a small <hi>Spark</hi> to that of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Now, since this Man
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65890:141"/> will not believe the Doctrine of the glorious Trinity, which the <hi>light</hi> of Divine <hi>Revelation</hi> hath so clearly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, because he cannot apprehend it by the <hi>dimm Light</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> let him take heed, lest that light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon which he so much depends, as to believe nothing true, which that doth not discover, do not in the end prove darkness; for, if it do,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.23.</note>
               <hi>How great is that darkness?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Author goeth on, and to magnifie the reason of Man, he tells us, <hi>'Tis the agreement even of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with humane Reason, that makes us know it to be the word of God;</hi> so he. To which I answer;</p>
            <p>The Precepts of the Scripture, being morally good, just, and equal, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to the right reason of Man; an enlightned understanding cannot but like them well; but this is not the only <hi>Character,</hi> whereby the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the Scriptures may be proved. Indeed, were its Precepts unholy, and contrary to the dictates of sound reason, it could not be the word of God; but yet the agreeableness of its Commands to the rectified reason of Man, is not enough to evidence that it certainly is so. For we find
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65890:142"/> many excellent <hi>Precepts</hi> of the same kind with those in the Scripture deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Heathen Moralists,</hi> whose Writings yet are not counted <hi>sacred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we know the Scriptures to be the word of God by evidences of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind. As for instance; 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the Scriptures should be the word of <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> good or bad, as might be easily proved; and if so, they must needs be from <hi>God.</hi> And that indeed they are so, may be further evidenced by the exact accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of such <hi>Prophecies,</hi> as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the most <hi>improbable Events;</hi> to which I need add no more Proofs, save only those stupendious <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were often and openly wrought pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to <hi>confirm</hi> those Doctrines, which our Bibles contain; Miracles not only delivered in the Scripture, but attested and recorded by other Writers.</p>
            <p>These are some of those motives, which induce us to believe that the Scriptures are the infallible word of that God, by whose certain <hi>Prescience</hi> such <hi>future</hi> Events were foretold, and by whose <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> such <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Works,</hi> as astonished their <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> were effected. But as to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of Scripture with humane
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65890:142"/> Reason, to urge that, as this Author seems to do, as the <hi>only</hi> or <hi>principal</hi> Medium, whereby we may prove or know its Divinity, is a new way of arguing: a <hi>Topick,</hi> which being alone without the conjunction of other and <hi>better Evidences,</hi> is, I think, peculiar to this Man only.</p>
            <p>But I must crave to mind this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that there are in the Scriptures some matters of <hi>Speculation,</hi> some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Faith,</hi> which are not very <hi>sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> to <hi>humane Reason;</hi> but far <hi>above</hi> the capacity of finite understandings. Such is the Doctrine of the <hi>Creation;</hi> for, <hi>Ex nihilo nil fit,</hi> saith the Reason of Man; and such is the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which Men of great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding have thought to be <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, inconvenient,</hi> and <hi>impossible.</hi> And such is the Doctrine of the blessed <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Natures in the Person of Christ; Doctrines transcending the highest reach of humane Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and yet being contained in the word of God, there lieth upon every Christian a necessary obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
            <p>To this our Author, in his 46<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Page, makes this reply; <hi>A Just God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65890:143"/> lay on us a necessity of submitting to those Terms and Conditions of Salvation, which we cannot possibly understand:</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>Bold worm! who dares not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the Son, but also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that God had dealt with <hi>Men,</hi> as he dealt with <hi>Angels;</hi> suppose that he had propounded to us <hi>no</hi> Terms of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, had he even so been <hi>unjust?</hi> if not, since his own free mercy inclined him to offer us some Conditions; is it fit, that <hi>He</hi> or <hi>We,</hi> should chuse them? and if his conditions do not <hi>please</hi> us, must we presently charge him with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,</hi> as, in effect, this Man doth? But, let him tell us, whether God, whose we are upon all accounts, may not, without any breach of his own <hi>Justice,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Creature Man to do any thing, which may be <hi>lawfully</hi> done, in order to his Salvation? if he may, then may he justly require us to <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of all his own Revelations, tho' the <hi>matter,</hi> contained in some of them, be far <hi>above</hi> our comprehension.</p>
            <p>True it is, we cannot apprehend <hi>how</hi> the Divine Nature, which is <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> but <hi>One,</hi> should be communicated to <hi>Three distinct Persons,</hi> and <hi>entirely subsist in each;</hi> nor are we able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65890:143"/> the manner <hi>how</hi> the <hi>finite</hi> Nature of Man, should be united to the <hi>infinite</hi> Nature of God in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without <hi>conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confusion,</hi> or possibility of <hi>separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for ever. But though we cannot comprehend these matters; yet our reason tells us, that we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, because the Scriptures do declare them either in <hi>express Terms,</hi> or by <hi>undeniable Consequences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that about these <hi>mysterious</hi> Points we are not to consult our <hi>reason,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be fit to believe them; but whether the Scriptures rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood do indeed contain them; and if once we find them there, our <hi>own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings</hi> must needs submit to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation,</hi> and own them all, how difficult soever they be, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truths of God.</p>
            <p>Now, whether the true meaning of such or such a Text be this or that, the <hi>Reason</hi> of Man must be the Judge; and consequently Men of the most <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Understandings,</hi> being also <hi>pious,</hi> sincere, and impartial, are the fittest Persons in the World to determine, upon mature advice and deliberation, regard being had to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65890:144"/> Faith and all necessary <hi>Circumstances,</hi> whether such or such a Text do sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie so or so.</p>
            <p>This being thus premised, I do now appeal to every impartial Reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not more safe, and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for us to understand those Texts, which are usually produced to prove the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as the <hi>most,</hi> the <hi>best</hi> the most <hi>devout,</hi> the most <hi>learned,</hi> and the most <hi>judicious</hi> Writers of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church have generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood them, than to understand them as this Man, and a <hi>few</hi> more of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, do interpret them against the judgment of <hi>Prime Antiquity,</hi> and the <hi>received Faith</hi> of the Christian Church in succeeding Ages.</p>

            <p>THE Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> being thus far opposed, and denied by this <hi>Seraphical Divine;</hi> he now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts the Work of a <hi>Casuist,</hi> deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or rather determining the <hi>future</hi> State of all them, who <hi>believe</hi> that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which he <hi>disowns;</hi> and the best thoughts, which he entertains concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us poor silly <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares

            <p>This favourable <hi>Aphorism</hi> contains the very highest Charity, which, in this Man's opinion, can be extended to us, or to any of those pious Persons, who formerly lived and died in the Faith of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> the whole of his kindness lieth in this, that although he thinks us to be very near the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> because we believe, what his <hi>infallible Reason</hi> tells him cannot be; yet he doth not universally exclude us from all <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this Act of Charity be in it self but very <hi>small,</hi> yet in a Man of his Principles 'tis somewhat <hi>strange;</hi> 'tis such, as in him cannot arise from Nature, Judgment and Deliberation, unless he resolve to contradict the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> in this, as he often doth in other matters. For, considering his <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> through his groundless Charity, he thinks some of us to be in a <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> not only <hi>without</hi> a <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> but even <hi>against</hi> the express Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of God. For, this Man, who denieth the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> doth well know, that we <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> them <hi>both</hi> as God, and give them
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65890:145"/> the self same <hi>Worship</hi> and Honour, which we give to God the <hi>Father;</hi> and if so, this Man, who believes that Christ and his Spirit are not God, must needs count us, who worship both as God, to be down-right <hi>Idolaters;</hi> that such we <hi>live,</hi> that such we <hi>die;</hi> and were we such indeed, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells what our fate must be, when he saith, <hi>Idolaters shall not inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> And if so, how comes this Man, who esteems us to be obstinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Idolaters, to lay down this positive Conclusion, <hi>Salvation and the belief of the Trinity are not inconsistent?</hi> may not any Man of his opinion say as well, <hi>Salvation and Idolatry, persisted in, and without Repentance, are not inconsistent; though</hi> St. <hi>Paul be of another mind?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>'Tis well for us, that this Man will allow us any place, <hi>Inter sanctorum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> even the lowest Room in Heaven; it will be happy for us, if we can but <hi>shine</hi> like the <hi>Stars</hi> in the <hi>Via lactea,</hi>

            <p>However, as to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of future Glory, the Doctrine of the <hi>Schools</hi> is this; they tell us, that in Heaven there is, <hi>Aurea &amp; Aureola,</hi> this latter they stile, <hi>Praemium essentiale additum,</hi> an <hi>Additional</hi> Reward <hi>over</hi> and above that, which is <hi>essential</hi> to the happiness of glorified Saints in common.<note place="margin">Aquin. in suppl. qu. 96.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65890:147"/>
               <hi>Price</hi> of our Redemption depends upon it.</p>
            <p>But there is yet something worse behind; for, our Author goeth on thus: <hi>In case Men of false Principles</hi> (meaning us <hi>Trinitarians) are told plainly that they are in the wrong, and yet they still do obstinately persist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and refuse to consider seriously the Arguments both of Scripture and Reason, that are offered</hi> (in his Book) <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, I see not how in any case 'tis possible for such to be saved:</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>The Summ of which amounts to thus much; that if we are not so far <hi>convinced</hi> by his <hi>Book.</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by himself to end this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, as to submit our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to his better Judgment, and to renounce the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> in his opinion, we cannot possibly be saved; as if all his <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> were infallible <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> and his <hi>sorry Pamphlet</hi> were the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how comes this Man, who new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told us, that <hi>Salvation and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Trinity are not inconsistent,</hi> so quickly to <hi>damn</hi> so many of us? 'Tis because we are not convinced by his reasonings, because we give not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65890:148"/> more credit to his <hi>Book,</hi> than to our <hi>Bibles;</hi> 'tis because we are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with by his <hi>Authority,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake that Established and Catholick Faith, which the strongest Arguments of all its opposers as yet could never shake. We are well assured that <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, Clemens, Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil, Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and many more <hi>Fathers, Confessors,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, were never removed from this Faith of theirs by all the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> of <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Arius, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius, Eunomius, Photinus,</hi> and other Hereticks; but they <hi>lived</hi> and <hi>died</hi> in the constant belief of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and yet notwithstanding what this Man saith, we do not doubt, but these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate <hi>Trinitarians</hi> are very safely got to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and therefore not one whit the worse for being such.</p>
            <p>Nor can this Man justly charge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>ancient</hi> or <hi>modern</hi> Defenders of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrine, with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal to consider seriously the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both from Scripture and Reason, that have been offered against it. Was not the whole Controversie maturely debated? were not the Scriptures on both sides examined? were not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>Arius</hi> duely weighed, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65890:148"/> fairly answered by <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice?</hi> the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> condemned <hi>Macedonius;</hi> the Council of <hi>Ephesus</hi> condemned <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Eutyches;</hi> and dare this Man so far charge these reverend Councils, as to say that they were <hi>rash</hi> in their <hi>determinations,</hi> and branded Men for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> without <hi>considering</hi> what they could say in defence of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? did not St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> first <hi>consider,</hi> duely <hi>examine,</hi> and then <hi>baffle</hi> the <hi>Arguments</hi> of <hi>Eunomius?</hi> did not <hi>Tertullian</hi> take the same course against <hi>Praxeas,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> against <hi>Maximinus</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop; and other Hereticks? and do not our modern Divines use the same method still? for how can we answer <hi>Socinian Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> if we do not duely <hi>consider</hi> them first? and if we do, why doth this Man insinuate and suppose the contrary?</p>
            <p>But since upon a strict Scrutiny, we find such Arguments to be but <hi>weak;</hi> since we find the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>abused,</hi> and wrested from its natural Sence; since we find <hi>humane Reason</hi> stretched beyond its just <hi>limits,</hi> employed about matters above its <hi>reach;</hi> nay, <hi>opposed</hi> even to <hi>Divine</hi> Revelation; since the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65890:149"/> case stands thus, though we are not convinced by any <hi>Socinian</hi> Arguments yet produced against the <hi>Trinity;</hi> yet do we not by resisting them, as this Man saith, <hi>Reject the Counsel of God, or do despite to the Spirit of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I may take a fair occasion to retort this, or a like Argument up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Man himself, and all others of his opinion, and tell them, If Men of false Principles, I mean our <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> will walk by a <hi>dimm Candle</hi> of their own in defiance to the <hi>clear Light</hi> of God's glorious <hi>Sun;</hi> if they will set up their own <hi>dark Reason,</hi> in opposition to the perspicuous <hi>Evidences</hi> of <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> if they will obstinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in an <hi>Heretical</hi> opinion, though the Scriptures and strong Arguments thence fairly deduced, are clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; though I will not pass a <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Sentence up on their future State; though I will not say of <hi>them,</hi> as this Man, in effect, doth of <hi>us,</hi> that 'tis impossible for them to be saved; yet say I will, that they are in great <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I take to be the Judgment of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; why else is that <hi>Creed,</hi> which bears the Name of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> received and owned as a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65890:149"/>
               <hi>System</hi> of the true and undoubted Faith? This <hi>Creed,</hi> having first decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Natures in the Person of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus, <hi>This is the Catholick Faith; which except a Man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved;</hi> which words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not only a <hi>danger,</hi> but a <hi>certainty</hi> of Damnation.</p>
            <p>Doubtless <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself, or whosoever else compiled and collected this <hi>Creed</hi> out of his Writings, would never have passed so <hi>severe</hi> a <hi>Censure</hi> without a very good Ground, and a sufficient Warrant for it. And were that substance of this <hi>Creed</hi> any way <hi>Heterodox</hi> and Erroneous, or were its dreadful <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> and concluding Sentence <hi>rash</hi> and groundless; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine that the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> from Age to Age should, not only <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace</hi> it, but <hi>insert</hi> it into her <hi>Liturgies,</hi> command all her Ministers to subscribe it, and to proclaim it often in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregations, thereby requiring every Man's assent unto it.</p>
            <p>Nor is this done without very good Reason; for our Lord himself hath said, <hi>He that believes not,</hi>

               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:65890:151"/> positive; and 'tis pronounced by the great Judge of Men and Angels, from whom there is no appeal; the only question is, what are those Objects of Faith, whereunto we must give our assent, or else be <hi>damned?</hi> Doubtless, 'tis not the <hi>whole History</hi> recorded by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> nor is it <hi>every</hi> truth delivered by our <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles;</hi> there are in both our Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments several things, whereof a Man may be ignorant without any hazard of his Salvation. But those Doctrines, which are absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed in order to it, are the <hi>Prime Fundamental</hi> Articles of our <hi>Creed;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is One, and a very great One too. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The main Foundation of our Christian Faith is this; <hi>That our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour hath fully satisfied the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice for the Sin of the World:</hi> For, if this be not so, then is every Man left to satisfie for <hi>himself,</hi> which yet no Man can ever do, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all Men without our Lord's satisfaction must perish for ever.</p>
            <p>Now, if the Doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> were not true, no such <hi>satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> could be supposed: For, if there
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65890:151"/> be but <hi>one</hi> Person in the Godhead, as this Man dreams, then our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is not God; and if he be not God, then could he not satisfie the demands of an offended and <hi>Infinite</hi> Justice for the Sin of Man.</p>
            <p>But that our Lord hath fully <hi>satisfied</hi> the Divine <hi>Justice</hi> is the firm Belief of the Catholick Church, and 'tis groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon several Texts. 'Tis said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12.</note>
               <hi>He hath obtained eternal Redemption for us;</hi> but how did he do it? did it cost him nothing? St. <hi>Paul</hi> answers,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.</note>
               <hi>We are bought with a Price;</hi> we are <hi>bought,</hi> there's the <hi>Purchase;</hi> with a <hi>Price,</hi> there's the <hi>Consideration</hi> paid. And what this <hi>Price</hi> was, the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle elsewhere tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</note>
               <hi>God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased his Church with his own Blood;</hi> and our Lord himself saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28</note>
               <hi>The Son of Man hath given his life a ransom for many.</hi> Certainly these Terms of <hi>buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, purchasing, redeeming,</hi> and <hi>ransom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> must needs imply a sufficient <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> offered, accepted, and paid.</p>
            <p>Now, to say, as this Man doth, that all these expressions are <hi>improper</hi> and figurative, is, not only to contradict the general Judgment of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, but even to elude the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and force them to say, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65890:152"/> Men think fit to countenance an ill opinion, and barely to serve a turn.</p>
            <p>But by vertue of these, and many more Texts, we stand obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our Lord hath indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely <hi>satisfied</hi> the Infinite <hi>Justice</hi> of his offended Father, and the doing thereof must needs prove him God; for 'tis impossible that the Blood of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>mere</hi> Man could do it. And this is enough to prove, that there are at least <hi>Two</hi> Persons in the Godhead, the one <hi>satisfied,</hi> the other <hi>satisfying.</hi> And this I take to be a <hi>fundamental</hi> point of our Religion, the belief whereof is necessary to our Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a fundamental point of our Religion, to believe that our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ought to be Religiously worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and adored.</p>
            <p>For our Lord himself hath told us, <hi>That all men should honour the Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 5.23.</note>
               <hi>as they honour the Father,</hi> as I have proved in a former Section, with <hi>equal</hi> honour. The Apostles did so,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.52</note>
               <hi>They worshiped him,</hi> and so do glorified <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in Heaven. <hi>Blessing, Honour, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.13.</note>
               <hi>and Power, be unto him that sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever, and ever:</hi> And this was no more than God the <hi>Father</hi> had commanded; <hi>When
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65890:152"/> he bringeth the first begotten into the World,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.</note>
               <hi>And let all the Angels of God worship him;</hi> and surely, if the whole <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Heaven are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to worship our Lord, the whole <hi>Race</hi> of Men are much more obliged to do so too.</p>
            <p>And certainly this <hi>religious</hi> Worship and Divine Honour, which is, and ought to be, done to Christ, is enough to prove his <hi>Godhead;</hi> for, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand runs thus;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10.</note>
               <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> Now, since we are <hi>forbid</hi> to worship any <hi>Creature,</hi> and yet <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> to worship <hi>Christ;</hi> 'tis plain, that he is more than a Creature; but that he cannot be, if he be not <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The belief of this, and a religious Practice suitable to such a Faith, seems absolutely necessary to Man's Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, our Lord hath said,<note place="margin">

               <hi>If ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that I am He, ye shall die in your Sins;</hi> what <hi>He</hi> doth he mean? certainly the very same, whom the Scriptures report him to be; and what say they concerning him?<note place="margin">

            <p>AND how this <hi>Socinian</hi> Authour can acquit himself from all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of this unpardonable Sin, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; for, though he doth not <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme</hi> this blessed Spirit at the same rate, as the <hi>Jews</hi> once did; yet he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi> attempts, and doth whatever he can, to disprove his <hi>Personality,</hi> as if he were no more than a <hi>Quality,</hi> or Power of God the Father, but not a Divine and distinct <hi>Being</hi> subsisting by himself. For with a world of confidence he tells us thus; <hi>'Tis plain from the general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy of true Faith, grounded on Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture evidence, that the Holy Ghost is no distinct Person subsisting of himself:</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>But if this indeed be so <hi>plainly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Word of God; how comes it to pass, that such vast Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of judicious, learned, and pious
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65890:154"/> Men, well versed in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, could never yet <hi>see</hi> it there? well, to inform us better, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this pretended Truth, tho' it be a real <hi>Heresie,</hi> he urgeth this sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Argument. <hi>If the Holy Ghost be a distinct Person, then 'tis clear that our Lord could not be the Son of him, who is now called God the Father, since 'tis plain that the Virgin</hi> Mary's <hi>conception was occasioned by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> To which I answer thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Lord, in respect of his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Nature, is the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son only; and that Person alone, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, is often called, <hi>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And our Lord himself, upon the same ground only is properly stiled some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>the begotten,</hi> and sometimes, <hi>the only begotten Son of God;</hi> a Title, which cannot fairly belong to him in respect of his <hi>Manhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Lord, in regard of his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Nature, may not unfitly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Son</hi> of the whole <hi>Trinity;</hi> the <hi>first</hi> Person <hi>contriving</hi> his Incarnation, the <hi>second</hi> freely <hi>consenting</hi> to it, and the <hi>third effecting</hi> it; and this doth rather prove than hinder the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Persons.</p>
            <pb n="288" facs="tcp:65890:155"/>
            <p>And now let us try the strength of this Man's Argument; <hi>The Holy Ghost,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not a distinct Person in the supposed Trinity,</hi> but why not? his Reason is this: <hi>Our Lord, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Holy Ghost is stiled the Son of the first Person, or God the Father; and if so, it should seem that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taer, and the Holy Ghost, are not perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally distinguished;</hi> That's the Substance of his Argument: To which I thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Lord was the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Person, long before his Conception of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65890:155"/> Matre, qui ante saecula aeternus est genitus ex Deo Patre.</hi> This Day was he <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi> his Mother, who was <hi>begotten</hi> of <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Father</hi> before all Ages, even from Eternity. So then, our Lord, upon this account, may very well be called, for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he is, the Son of the <hi>first</hi> Person; and yet this <hi>first</hi> Person may be, and is, distinguished from the <hi>third,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this Eternal <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> was no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We grant that our Lord, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his <hi>humane</hi> Nature conceived by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> was to be called, as the <hi>Angel</hi> told his Mother, the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but how this proves, that God the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are not Personally <hi>distinguished,</hi> I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>For, the Angel doth not say, <hi>He shall be called the Son of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> Person <hi>only,</hi> excluding the <hi>second</hi> and the <hi>third.</hi> Nor may we here restrain the Name of <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>first</hi> Person only; for our Lord, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as the first, was the Son of God by <hi>Creation;</hi> a Work, wherein the <hi>whole Trinity</hi> had an <hi>equal</hi> hand. And whereas the Creation of our Lord's <hi>humane</hi> Nature is here par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65890:156"/> ascribed to the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and whereas 'tis said, <hi>Therefore that holy thing shall be called the Son of God,</hi> the most <hi>genuine</hi> and natural inference, which can thence be raised, is this; namely, that <hi>the Holy Ghost is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this our <hi>Socinian</hi> denieth, and tells us, <hi>'Tis evident from these addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional words,</hi> And the Power of the highest shall overshadow thee, <hi>that the Holy Ghost is only that Divine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Power of God, by which he works his will and pleasure in the World; and by consequence, that God and the Spirit of God are no more two distinct Persons, than man and the spirit of man are;</hi> so he. I answer,</p>
            <p>This Speech of the <hi>Angel</hi> contains two things: 1. The <hi>Person,</hi> who was designed to be the <hi>immediate Authour,</hi> and efficient Cause of this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conception; namely, the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> 2. The <hi>Instrumental means,</hi> whereby this wonderful Work was to be wrought; namely, the <hi>Power of the highest,</hi> the Omnipotence of God. And if this distinction be allowed, then did the <hi>Angel</hi> speak like himself, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise not; for, if by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>Power of the highest,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel means but <hi>one</hi> and the same thing,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65890:156"/> then here's an <hi>Instrument</hi> mention'd, but no <hi>Agent</hi> to use it; here's a <hi>Work</hi> to be done, but no <hi>Authour</hi> to do it; here's a <hi>Son</hi> to be <hi>conceived</hi> and born of a Virgin, but none to supply the place of a <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to gratifie this Authour, let us suppose that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the Power of the highest;</hi> yet now will this Title prove that he is indeed <hi>no Person;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles our blessed Saviour, <hi>the Power of God,</hi> which is all one with the <hi>Power of the highest.</hi> And dares this Man take occasion from this <hi>Character,</hi> to say that our Lord is <hi>no Person,</hi> but a meer <hi>quality</hi> only? if not, if this Title, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ascribes unto <hi>Christ,</hi> do not disprove his <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi> and distinction from his Father; why should the <hi>same</hi> Title, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by an Angel to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> disprove his?</p>
            <p>And whereas this Man boldly saith, <hi>That God and the Spirit of God are no more two distinct Persons, than Man and the Spirit of Man are;</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Man cannot be <hi>two</hi> distinct Persons, because Man without his <hi>Spirit</hi> cannot be so much as <hi>One;</hi> but 'tis not so with God. Now, to shew the Falshood of this
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65890:157"/> Man's assertion, I shall prove these two things; 1. That the blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is indeed a <hi>Person.</hi> 2. That he is a <hi>Person distinct,</hi> both from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son.</p>

            <p>And thus do our modern <hi>Socinians</hi> argue against the Doctrine of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> by finite and corporeal Beings, they measure Beings infinite and incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and because the <hi>humane</hi> Nature subsisting in three distinct Persons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes three <hi>Men;</hi> and the <hi>Angelical</hi> Nature subsisting in three distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, doth make three <hi>Angels:</hi> They hence conclude, that if the <hi>Divine</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth equally subsist in <hi>Three</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Persons,</hi> there must needs be <hi>three Gods.</hi> But doth the Nature of <hi>Men, Angels,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> fall under the same considerations? the Nature of Men and

But how <hi>one</hi> and the same <hi>numerical</hi> Nature should equally subsist in three distinct Persons, how each of the <hi>Three</hi> should be God, and yet God be but <hi>One,</hi> is a difficulty ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to be explained. But in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this kind, we must submit <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason</hi> to <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> and sure I am, if no <hi>Trinitarian</hi> were able to return a satisfactory Answer to those <hi>Arguments,</hi> which our <hi>Socinians</hi> urge <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Trinity;</hi> yet no <hi>Socinian</hi> as yet ever did, nor, I think, ever can fairly answer those <hi>Texts,</hi> which we plead <hi>for it.</hi> And if so, whether we ought to give more credit to the <hi>fallible Reasonings</hi> of Men, than to the <hi>infallible Word</hi> of God, let every impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge.</p>
            <p>And judge he may with the greater ease, because, so far as <hi>humane Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is of any value in our present case, we have the <hi>fairest</hi> on our side; for the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65890:164"/> Defenders of the <hi>Trinity</hi> are, to speak modestly, Persons at least of <hi>equal weight</hi> with their opposers; and to be sure, they are far, very far the <hi>greater Number;</hi> I think, an hundred for one; and our hundred have been as much concerned, as their one could be, not to commit the Sin of Idolatry by worshiping any Person, who is not truly God.</p>
            <p>It's true, in those early Ages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this dispute concerning the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> was first raised, and by degrees began to grow, the Defenders of this Doctrine could have no humane Authority to give it countenance; but they then had, and we still have far better Evidences to prove it. For, we do not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> any farther, than as they are well bottomed upon the sacred <hi>Word</hi> of God, which, in this case especially, is to us the <hi>only</hi> rule and ground of Faith. But since we think that the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> who were learned and pious Men, chiefly when met in Councils, were very <hi>able</hi> to <hi>apprehend,</hi> and very <hi>conscientious</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> the true meaning of the Holy Scriptures; and since the generality of <hi>succeeding Divines</hi> in after Ages, have
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65890:165"/> approv'd the Judgment of the four first <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Councils, and many other excellent Writers; we cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by all the pretences of humane Reason, to alter our opinion about the sence of those many Texts, which have been judged by such vast Numbers of such incomparable Persons, so plainly to assert the <hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> And the rather, because those <hi>other Interpretations,</hi> which the opposers of this Doctrine do even force upon those Texts, which make against them, are so <hi>impertinent,</hi> wild, absurd, and indeed intolerable, that, were it not to serve a turn, they could never be owned by those <hi>Socinians,</hi> who esteem themselves such great <hi>masters</hi> of <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did a <hi>figurative</hi> interpretation of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral plain Passages in the Writings of St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tend to overthrow the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hypothesis, they might as <hi>justly</hi> abhorr the thoughts of any <hi>Tropes</hi> in those Speeches of the Evangelist and Apostle, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks <hi>unjustly</hi> do in those words of Christ: <hi>This is my Body, This is my Blood.</hi>

            <p>Now then, from these forenamed Texts, and these Authorities of Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men grounded thereupon, we may safely conclude that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is possest with a <hi>creating</hi> Power, which being Omnipotent and Essential to him must needs prove him God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures do ascribe to the Holy Spirit the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and that is a second Work, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an Almighty Power, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his to be so.</p>
            <p>There are so many difficulties in, and such strong Objections against the Doctrine of the Resurrection, that the Learned Men of the Heathen World, though some of them granted the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> of the Soul, yet the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Body they thought to be not only needless and inconvenient, but altogether <hi>Impracticable</hi> too.

               <hi>How say some among you, that there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Dead?</hi> Now, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why this great Article of our Faith was so generally denied, must be the consideration of those Intricacies which are found in the Nature of this word, there being much to be said <hi>against</hi> it, but nothing <hi>for</hi> it, save only the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Promise, the Infinite Wisdom, and Almighty Power of God.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Holy Spirit hath an hand in the raising of the Dead, is evident from that of St. <hi>Paul:</hi>

            <p>But to enervate these Arguments, and to elude those Texts, upon which they are grounded, our <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us, that such Texts are <hi>Figurative,</hi> that there is in them a <hi>Prosopopoeia;</hi> whereby <hi>Personal Actions</hi> are often ascribed to <hi>things</hi> or qualities, which are not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of Charity, It <hi>beareth all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Co. 13.7.</note>
               <hi>it believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi> These and other <hi>Personal</hi> Actions are attributed to <hi>Charity,</hi> which yet are proper to the <hi>Person</hi> only, in whom that noble Grace resides. So in our
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65890:182"/> present case, they tell us, that those <hi>Divine</hi> Actions are <hi>Figuratively</hi> ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> not that this Spirit is a <hi>Person</hi> subsisting in Co-operating of himself; but because he is the <hi>Power</hi> of God the <hi>Father,</hi> who thereby doth the works: So they. To which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>This pretence of a <hi>Prosopopoeia,</hi> as if those Personal Acts were really done by God the Father, which are only imputed to the Spirit, as being no more than the Power by which the Father works, will appear very absurd and ridiculous, if we can find some <hi>personal operations</hi> ascribed to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which can never be ascribed to the <hi>Father.</hi> As for instance; the Holy Spirit is said to come, as <hi>being sent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14.26.</note> but by whom, can God the Father be sent? the Holy Spirit is said <hi>to receive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.13, 14.</note> but from what Donor's hand can God the <hi>Father</hi> be a Receiver? the Holy Spirit is said not to speake of himself, but who prompts and puts words into the mouth of God the <hi>Father?</hi> the Holy Spirit is said to make Intercession for us,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> but can God the <hi>Father</hi> become an Intercessor? if he can, let our <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us, with whom he interceeds. These
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65890:183"/> Instances are enough to evince, that the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> is not a <hi>quality;</hi> not that Energetical Power by which the Father acts, but a <hi>Person</hi> really subsisting in himself, since such Personal operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Attributed to him, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any <hi>Prosopopoeia</hi> be ascribed to God the <hi>Father.</hi>

            <p>But to name no more Texts, we find a plain distinction betwixt all three Persons in the Form of Baptism, which must be administred,<note place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note>
               <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</hi> If these three here mention'd, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are allowed to be, what they certainly are, the <hi>three Persons</hi> in the God head, then is this Form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism very consonant to its self, and Intelligible to us: but if not, if, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hypothesis,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65890:184"/> the first here nam'd be a <hi>Person,</hi> and that Person <hi>God;</hi> if the second be a <hi>Person,</hi> and that Person no more than a <hi>meer Man;</hi> and if the third be <hi>no</hi> Person at all; then must this Form of Baptism be thus Interpreted: <hi>Baptizing them in the name,</hi> i. e. by the <hi>Authority,</hi> or into the <hi>Religion</hi> and Worship of the <hi>Father,</hi> who is <hi>God;</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> who is a <hi>Creature;</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who is nothing else but a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, a <hi>Quality</hi> inherent in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God.</p>
            <p>And is it imaginable that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, who is the <hi>Wisdom of God, who spake as never man spake besides,</hi> should institute such an uncouth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent, and absurd Form of Baptism, as this must be, if so interpreted? Is it imaginable that our Meek and Humble Jesus, had he been no more than a meer Man, would ever, in this sacred Institution, have joyned <hi>himself</hi> with God his Father, as if his <hi>Authority</hi> were, and his <hi>Worship</hi> ought to be, the very same with his; nor can we conceive, that our Lord would here have made a <hi>distinct</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> if
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65890:185"/> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were not a distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but only the Power of God, for his Power, and all his other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, though we frame to our selves distinct Ideas and various Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, yet they are not really distinct from his Essence, they are himself.</p>
            <p>And thus have I examined all this Man's pretences, and answered all his Arguments against the Doctrine of the blessed <hi>Trinity;</hi> and notwithstanding all that he doth, or ever can, object against the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ and the <hi>Personality</hi> of the Holy Ghost, I shall conclude this discourse with the words of a far better Author,<note place="margin">Greg Naz Or. 44. p. 711.</note>

            <p>IF you really have, what Men do generally pretend, any considerable Value for your own Immortal Soul, take heed of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> against the <hi>Son,</hi> but <hi>especially</hi> against the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65890:186"/> for that is a Crime <hi>already</hi> pronounced to be irremissible. Take heed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in your present <hi>Heretical</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, denying the Deity of those two glorious Persons, to whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do ascribe such Titles, such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and such Operations, as are peculiar and proper to God alone. When St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>The Word was God,</hi> and proves it thus; <hi>By him all things were made,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>God blessed for ever,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ascribes to him the Creation of the Universe; nay, when God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> saith to his <hi>Son, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever:</hi> Why should you, in a flat contradiction to these and other plain Texts, deny his Divinity?</p>
            <p>And when St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>The Word was made Flesh,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God was manifested in the Flesh;</hi> and again, <hi>He took upon him the Seed of Abraham,</hi> when the Scriptures call our Saviour sometimes <hi>God,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Man;</hi> why should you deny the Union of the Divine and Humane Natures in his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Person?

               </gap>, the grand <hi>Secretary,</hi> and <hi>Interpreter</hi> of Nature's <hi>Mysteries,</hi> was even confounded in his thoughts about the Motions of <hi>Euripus.</hi> And if the Secrets of <hi>Nature</hi> do thus puzzle the <hi>Reason</hi> of Man, how can we hope throughly to understand <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the deep things of God?</hi> the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of his <hi>Nature</hi> and his <hi>Religion.</hi>

            <p>I am apt to think, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is as easie to Humane <hi>Reason,</hi> as that of God's <hi>Self-existence, Eternity, Immensity,</hi> and <hi>Omnipresence;</hi> indeed, that there must be one self-existent Being without a beginning, our own Reason is able to convince us; but <hi>how</hi> it should be so, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell us.

Nor could we frame unto our selves any better Idea's of God's <hi>Immensity</hi> and <hi>Omnipresence</hi> without extension. It was well observed by <hi>Tertullian, scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator Majestatis opprimetur à gloriâ.</hi> He that shall dive too far into the Infinite Perfections of God, will quickly find himself at a loss and overwhelmed.

               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:65890:188"/> The <hi>more</hi> I consider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, the <hi>less</hi> do I apprehend it. And for this reason did <hi>Plato</hi> stile God <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>But although the short-sighted Eye of Humane Reason can never take a full view of the Divine Nature, and its Infinite Perfections, its Self-existence, its Eternity, its Immensity and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence; yet these Attributes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared in the Holy Scriptures, we do generally pretend to believe them, though we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, and why then should you not believe the <hi>Trinity</hi> too? for, sure it is, that those Texts, which prove these Infinite Perfections, which pass Man's understanding, to be found in the Divine Nature, are not more <hi>express</hi> and plain, than those which prove a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons in the Godhead.</p>
            <pb n="353" facs="tcp:65890:188"/>
            <p>And let our <hi>Socinians</hi> take heed of deceiving themselves and others, by saying that those Texts, which assert the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are <hi>improper</hi> expressions, and must be <hi>figuratively</hi> understood.

I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my present Faith, and become your Proselyte, and own my self to be, though as yet I think I never shall be, a <hi>Socinian.</hi> To make me a Man of that opinion, the <hi>reasonings</hi> of Man's fallible Understanding will not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; but several Texts must either be proved to be <hi>no part</hi> of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and blotted out of our Bibles; or else they must be more <hi>fairly interpreted</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:65890:191"/> some other way, than as yet they ever have been. But to expunge any part of the Scripture, were grosly <hi>impious</hi> and sacrilegious; to expound any Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the received Sence of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> Church, were very highly <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;</hi> to imagine <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> where the <hi>literal</hi> Sence is plain, easie, and very consonant to the Analogy of Faith, what were this; but, <hi>Nodum in Scirpo quaerere?</hi> to seek and pretend Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties where indeed there are none? what were this, but, with <hi>Origen,</hi> to turn the <hi>plain</hi> letter into <hi>Allegory?</hi> This is the Course, which <hi>Hereticks</hi> have been wont to take, that they might elude the sacred Writ, and force the <hi>good Word</hi> of God to serve the ill <hi>opinions</hi> of Men.</p>
